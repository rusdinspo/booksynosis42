By the author of Give Us a Kiss and Tomato Red. 17,500 first printing.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, June 2001:</b> This is Daniel Woodrell's third book set in the Ozarks and, like the other two, <i>Give Us a Kiss</i> and <i>Tomato Red</i>, it peels back the layers from lives already made bare by poverty and petty crime, exposing the reader to the raw everyday hopes and fears of the poor and the helpless.<p> Told through the voice of an overweight 13-year-old boy named Shuggy Atkins, this is the story of Shug; the one person who loves him, his mother Glenda; and her boyfriend Red, a brutal and ignorant man. Red hates Shug but uses him to break into houses to steal drugs and anything else that can be sold. Glenda makes a meager living looking after the local cemetery and spends her time trying to keep Red amused and away from Shug, whom he loves to humiliate but whom she adores. Glenda is Shug's only champion. She calls him Sweet Mister as she continually boosts his confidence and promises a better life for him, if not for herself.</p><p> But when Glenda sees a beautiful, green Thunderbird with leather seats and its driver, Jimmy Vin Pearce, a chain of events is set into motion that will end in violence and bloodshed. Glenda must keep hidden from Red her infatuation with Jimmy Vin's money and fine clothes while she and Shug dream separate dreams of making a new life away from the violence.</p><p> Woodrell writes books that are small in volume but large in scope. It is impossible to put down this story of less than 200 pages until the final tragedy unfolds. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Daniel Woodrell is the author of six novels, including the <i>New York Times</i> Notable Books<i> Give Us a Kiss</i> and <i>Tomato Red</i>, which won the PEN West Fiction Award in l998. Though often compared to William Faulkner and Erskine Caldwell, he is in fact an original. As <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> wrote, "He's only drawing from the same well they did, but with a different take, a different voice, a sharper sense of irony."</p><h2>El Guero</h2><p>A story of survival, set in the late 1800s in Mexico and Baja California, based on the boyhood adventures of the author&#39;s father-in-law, the real El Guero.</p><p></p><h2>Life Worth Living: How Someone You Love Can Still Enjoy Life in a Nursing Home-The Eden Alternative in Action</h2><p>The grassroots handbook for Edenizing nursing homes.</p><p>Bill Thomas is a Harvard-educated medical doctor with a special concern for the elderly and a gift for storytelling. <p>Dr. Thomas is a native of upstate New York and attended the State University College at Cortland, where he earned a B.S. in Biology, summa cum laude, in 1982. </p><p>Before graduating from Harvard Medical School in 1986, Bill served as one of the founding editors of Murmurs, a quarterly journal of opinion. A three-year residency in Family Medicine at the University of Rochester followed medical school, and, in his third year of training, Bill was selected by the Mead Johnson Foundation as one of the top Family Medicine residents in the country. </p><p>Now Board Certified in Family Medicine and Geriatrics, Dr. Thomas has settled into a rural corner of Chenango County with his wife and partner, Judy Meyers-Thomas, as well as their five children, Zachary, Virgil, Haleigh Jane, Hannah, and Caleb. </p><p>Dr. Thomas enjoys a professional life that includes patient care, medical administration, teaching, research and writing, advocacy, public speaking, and developing software and information-technology solutions for health care organizations. </p><p>Since 1991, Bill and Judy have worked tirelessly to improve the quality of life for nursing home residents everywhere. Their work, known as the Eden Alternative, has attracted international attention and is transforming the way we think about and care for our elders.</p>Most American nursing homes spend far too much time treating chronic diseases and too little time providing compassionate care, asserts the author, a physician and former director of the Chase Memorial Nursing Home. In 1991, Thomas decided to try a different approach to life for the 80 residents of this upstate New York facility?an approach he calls the Eden Alternative. Motivated by a desire to enrich the home's physical and social environment, the staff introduced hundreds of indoor plants, 80 parakeets, dogs, cats, and other living things to share life with residents. Lawns became vegetable gardens, tended by staff and residents. A day-care center, after-school programs, and a summer camp brought children into the home. This book is an inspiring account of Edenizing this particular home, emphasizing the benefits to residents and staff. Although it offers how-to steps for humanizing homes elsewhere, it lacks the specifics needed to help the Eden Alternative succeed in larger, urban nursing facilities and other settings. Also not covered are difficulties this approach may present (e.g., demented residents who may be frightened of animals). For strong aging collections.?Karen McNally Bensing, Benjamin Rose Inst.

The driving force: gunpowder. The principal agents: galleys (long, low boats propelled principally by oars) and galleons (heavy, square rigged sailing ships). Suddenly, Europe, formerly on a technological par with India and China, dominated the waters. They crossed the Atlantic, reached America, and became world powers. A beautifully written account of the age conveys exactly how a country like Portugal could establish outposts from South America to the Pacific, how Christian fleets wrested control of the Mediterranean from the Ottoman Empire, and why the "invincible" Spanish armada met with disaster in its attempt to invade England.

Tarken and Martin would be tinkering with the truck, which was our livelihood. Galilee would be watching Martin, because they had started seeing each other before and after work. Or she would be cleaning her little house, or washing her clothes. I never saw Galilee bored or idle.<br> <br>But I didn&#x2019;t have to be at Martin&#x2019;s until late that afternoon, so I was doing whatever I pleased. That morning I was pleased to get rid of my hair.<br> <br>My neighbor Chrissie was not too bright, but I&#x2019;d watched her trim her husband&#x2019;s hair and beard as he sat on a stool outside their cabin. She&#x2019;d done a good job. She sang as she worked, in her sweet, high voice, and she told me about her youngest one&#x2019;s adventures with a frog in the creek.<br> <br>When she was halfway done, she said, &#x201c;Why you want to cut all this off? It&#x2019;s so pretty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It gets all sweaty and sticks to my neck,&#x201d; I said. Which was true. It was only spring now, but it would be the hot season soon.<br> <br>&#x201c;You better wear you a hat so your head won&#x2019;t get all red and tender,&#x201d; Chrissie said. &#x201c;You want it so short I think the sun might get your scalp.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care,&#x201d; I said, holding up the only little mirror Chrissie had. I could see part of my head at a time. She&#x2019;d washed it, so my hair was wet. I thought it was about an inch long. Looked like the curl was gone, but I wouldn&#x2019;t know until it dried.<br> <br>&#x201c;You heading out soon? I saw them farmers at Martin&#x2019;s place, when I was coming back from the store.&#x201d; Chrissie&#x2019;s trousers had long tendrils of dark hair all over &#x2019;em now. She&#x2019;d have to brush &#x2019;em.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, we&#x2019;re leaving as soon as it&#x2019;s near dark.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t you scared?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sure, I was. &#x201c;Of course not, the only ones should be scared are anyone who tries to get in our way.&#x201d; I smiled.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll kill &#x2019;em dead, bang, bang,&#x201d; Chrissie said in a singsong voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep. Bang, bang,&#x201d; I agreed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are they going to New America?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The farmers? The part of Texas they live in got swallowed up by Mexico a few years ago. You remember?&#x201d;<br> <br>Chrissie looked dim. She shook her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyway, the government down there has been telling the Texans that they&#x2019;re not real Mexicans, and their land is forfeit.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chrissie looked even dimmer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Their land is getting taken. So if they&#x2019;ve got kin up north or anywhere, even in Dixie, they got to leave Mexico to have a chance.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dixie was so poor and so dangerous you&#x2019;d have to be desperate to flee there.<br> <br>Chrissie ran her fingers through the short hair on the left side of my head, and shook her head. &#x201c;Anyone ever go to the HRE?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chrissie,&#x201d; I said. She bent around to meet my eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, sorry, Lizbeth.&#x201d; She began to work on the right side, following her own whim. I tried to remember if I&#x2019;d ever seen her cut anyone&#x2019;s hair besides Norton&#x2019;s. &#x201c;I forgot you don&#x2019;t like them grigoris.&#x201d;<br> <br>No. I did not like magicians.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tarken know you&#x2019;re doing this?&#x201d; she said after a moment. I could tell by the faraway sound of her voice that the question had come from her mouth, not her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, he doesn&#x2019;t have a say in my hair. Don&#x2019;t you go telling.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll see it this afternoon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s a surprise,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Chrissie gave me one of those looks that reminded me she was older than I was. &#x201c;He ain&#x2019;t gonna like it, Lizbeth.&#x201d;<br> <br>I raised up my shoulders, very carefully, because I didn&#x2019;t want to jolt her hand. &#x201c;Not his head,&#x201d; I said, and that was the truth. But it was also true that he&#x2019;d tried to tell me how I should do something one time too many.<br> <br>When Chrissie had finished, and the little mirror told me it was cut evenly all over&#x2014;God knows how&#x2014;I paid her. She gave me a big smile before she carried the chair inside. She came back out to pump some water to wash her hands, and put some in a bucket to toss around, trying to spread out the long, dark hair that lay in a heap where the chair had stood.<br> <br>I gave her a hand. When the dirt didn&#x2019;t look like the sky had snowed black ringlets, I went uphill to my place.<br> <br>Getting ready to leave didn&#x2019;t take long. We should only be gone maybe three nights, at most. And we might even spring for a room in one of the hotels in Corbin . . . providing Tarken was speaking to me by then. We&#x2019;d get the farmers up to their waiting family, then we&#x2019;d come right home. It was the most common run we made, and Martin and Tarken had cleared a road to there, mostly on an old paved one. They&#x2019;d moved all the big rocks and trees, scouted out the likely ambush sites, and so on.<br> <br>Corbin was over the border in New America, which was where almost all our cargo was bound. It was a bustling town with a number of places to stay, a garage for cars, a stable for horses, a post office, a good general store.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d worked for Tarken for two years now, maybe a bit over, and he&#x2019;d been my man for four months. The first time we went to bed, he told me he&#x2019;d been waiting until I was old enough.<br> <br>I hadn&#x2019;t even realized he was looking at me. I&#x2019;m slow that way. But I&#x2019;m quick with a gun, that&#x2019;s what counts.<br> <br>I would never have known I had a talent if my stepfather, Jackson, hadn&#x2019;t taken me hunting with him when I was little. Jackson had seen me snatch a fly out of the air, he told me later, and he&#x2019;d thought I had the quick hands and the instincts you needed to be a gunnie.<br> <br>Jackson was right. The first time I held a rifle in my hands, I knew I&#x2019;d found my calling. My mother didn&#x2019;t like it, of course, but at least I could support myself&#x2014;and be out in the open&#x2014;doing something useful. People need protection.<br> <br>I stuck a pair of pants and a shirt into my small leather bag, a pair of underpants, my toothbrush, and a comb. Packing was done. I&#x2019;d fill my canteens before I left.<br> <br>Next I cleaned my old 1873 Winchester, a lever action and a great rifle. It had been my grandfather&#x2019;s. He&#x2019;d called it Jackhammer, so I did, too. Jackson had given me matched Colt 1911s for close work, and those were already clean after my last target-shooting session out in the empty land around Segundo Mexia. I could fire twenty-seven bullets with all three, had extra magazines ready for the Colts. If I couldn&#x2019;t bring our enemies down with that much firepower, our enemies had an army.<br> <br>Galilee would bring her rifle, a Krag, since she was better at long shooting. I&#x2019;d use the Winchester for the nearer work. She and Martin and Tarken all had pistols, too, though Tarken&#x2019;s was less than a great tool.<br> <br>Our truck and our firepower had worked for two years. We&#x2019;d made this same run often.<br> <br>Winchester in its sling over my back, pistols in their holsters and ready to go, two full canteens on one shoulder, my little leather bag with clothes and extra ammo on another; I was ready. I set off down the path to town.<br> <br>People were coming home from work, and Chrissie was cooking on a grill outside her cabin, the smoke rising up and the smell of meat giving the air a nice tang. &#x201c;Good shooting!&#x201d; she called in her soft voice.<br> <br>I nodded. I passed Rex Santino. &#x201c;Easy death,&#x201d; he said in his gruff way.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what people wished gunnies. It made me feel good. I nodded back at him.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t want to walk down Main Street. There were too many people. One of them was my mother, who lived with Jackson in a real nice house just off Main. She didn&#x2019;t like to see me leave on a job. That weakened me, too. I took a roundabout way to Martin&#x2019;s house, which was situated in a bare dirt lot on the last street north in Segundo Mexia.<br> <br>Martin&#x2019;s chickens squawked in their pen as I came into the yard. He was strewing feed and smiling, just a little. He sure liked those stupid chickens. His neighbor&#x2019;s kids would come in to feed them while Martin was gone, in exchange for eggs. We do a lot of barter in Segundo Mexia.<br> <br>The setting sun struck Martin&#x2019;s head with a golden glow. For the first time I noticed that his light hair had a lot of gray sprinkled in. I would pick my time to tease him about it.<br> <br>Galilee wasn&#x2019;t there yet. Tarken was putting the cans of extra gas on the bed of the truck, and he gave me a sideways smile, which froze when he realized my hair was gone. After a minute he closed his eyes, shook his head, and started back to working.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d hear about this later. I smiled. It was going to be fun.<br> <br>Most of the cargo was sitting on the dirt of the yard or on Martin&#x2019;s front porch. Two of the children were playing a game of hopscotch on the grid they&#x2019;d drawn in the dirt. I nodded in their direction. I would talk to them when I couldn&#x2019;t dodge it.<br> <br>The sky went lower, the people on the porch shared out food among themselves, and I went into Martin&#x2019;s kitchen and ate some bread and some dried fruit. I couldn&#x2019;t handle meat before a job.<br> <br>Galilee came in to sit with me, her Krag under her arm. She had on a gun belt with one pistol, maybe not as fine as my Colts&#x2014;but the Colts were courtesy of Jackson, so I didn&#x2019;t crow about them . . . much. Her hair stood out from her head like a huge black puff, and she was very skinny and dark. &#x201c;My friend, you look a sight,&#x201d; she said when she got a good look at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Like it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hell, no. You had the prettiest white-person hair I ever saw. Why&#x2019;d you do it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tarken liked it too much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you decided you&#x2019;d show him what was what.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shrugged. &#x201c;More or less.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Girl. Sometimes I can tell you are so young.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know what that meant, so I didn&#x2019;t answer. Only, I&#x2019;d figured since Tarken spent so long running his fingers through my hair, straightening out each ringlet to watch it bounce back into curl, he&#x2019;d better pay more attention to the girl whose scalp it grew on.<br> <br>Galilee talked about other stuff. &#x201c;Freedom built a chair for his little house,&#x201d; she told me. Her son Freedom, who&#x2019;d been born when Galilee was only fourteen, had moved out of his mom&#x2019;s house when he left school and had gotten a job at the tannery. Now he&#x2019;d built his own place. (And a chair.)<br> <br>&#x201c;He going to find a carpenter to apprentice to?&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t think of anyone around who&#x2019;d be ready to hire. Bobby Saw already had a girl working for him.<br> <br>Galilee lost some smile. &#x201c;You know Freedom. That boy can&#x2019;t stick with nothing. At least, not that he&#x2019;s found yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That boy&#x201d; and I were nearly the same age. At least Freedom had stuck with the tannery job. Though he didn&#x2019;t like the work, it was steady money. He kept looking for something else, but nothing had suited him yet. Last time I&#x2019;d seen him in a bar, he&#x2019;d groused about it nonstop. He was lucky his girlfriend was sticking with him. Complaining is not attractive.<br> <br>Martin came in to get a drink, kissed Galilee on the cheek as he went by. My eyebrows tried to climb into my hair, what was left of it. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I said when he&#x2019;d gone back out. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re out in the open with it. When did that happen?&#x201d;<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t meet my eyes, but she was smiling again. &#x201c;Just seemed like it was time. We&#x2019;re getting along good, we want to spend more time together than we are. Ain&#x2019;t no big thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yet,&#x201d; she agreed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lizbeth,&#x201d; Tarken called from the yard.<br> <br>&#x201c;Time to work,&#x201d; Galilee said, and we washed our plates and went to the outhouse and then to the truck. It was spring, days lengthening, and the sun didn&#x2019;t want to give up the sky. There were no clouds, and I stood looking up, seeing the vastness above me, nothing between me and the hereafter. I had my place, standing here on this dirt.<br> <br>Tarken gave us the nod. He and Martin were taking one last-minute look at the engine.<br> <br>Galilee and I turned to the cargo. &#x201c;Time to load up,&#x201d; I called. &#x201c;Sit in the center, looking out. Her and me, we got to stand up, her at the right side close to the back, me at the left side, closer to the front.&#x201d; I pointed. I had to be clear. They were nervous.<br> <br>Tarken would cover the straight-ahead from the passenger seat in the cab.<br> <br>Martin had already arranged their bags against the sides, with two gaps left for me and Galilee just where we wanted them. The cargo had brought too much stuff, but they&#x2019;d tried to pack it all in. They hated to leave things. This was all they had in the world.<br> <br>The long, flat bed had sides Martin and Tarken had built, wooden uprights and horizontal planks, to hold everyone and everything in. Provided a little protection, too. And that gave Galilee and me a stable frame to lean on. We would go in last.<br> <br>The families were standing, milling around, putting it off. &#x201c;Load up,&#x201d; I called with a little more push to my voice.<br> <br>They obeyed. One man went in first, to help pull up the wives and the children, while the other remained on the ground to boost &#x2019;em up. The younger couple had a baby and a couple of littles, maybe six and four. The older couple had a girl, grown, and another girl about thirteen, and a boy, younger but not a baby. The men were brothers. They&#x2019;d had farms side by side in south Texas, but when it had become Mexico, they had gradually been pushed out. Their older brother, they&#x2019;d told Martin, was the one paying for their trip to New America. He was smarter; he&#x2019;d sold his farm while he still had title to it, and bought land north of Corbin.<br> <br>It seemed to take a long time, but finally they were all in. Galilee and I scrambled up and took our places. It was Galilee&#x2019;s turn to talk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hear me,&#x201d; she said, and they all turned their faces to her. Dixie people wouldn&#x2019;t have listened to a black woman, but these farmers did. She had the way and voice of someone who knew what she was doing. Her rifle spoke for her, too.<br> <br>Galilee gave them the usual lecture about staying low and helping us keep watch. They all nodded, even the littles, scared just about shitless. Our prime worry was bandits, who wanted anything they could get: guns, goods, the human cargo. The guns and goods could be used or sold. The humans could be robbed or raped, and then sold to a bordello that wasn&#x2019;t too choosy.<br> <br>If the New America patrols stopped us, we&#x2019;d be fine. People were legal cargo, and respectable people like this were even welcome in New America. But if bandits caught us, well, that was why Galilee and I were on duty. That was why the oldest brother had hired us to get the two families through the lawless land along the border between Texoma and New America.<br> <br>Martin had climbed into the driver&#x2019;s seat, and Tarken had taken the shotgun position, as usual. I stretched forward to rap on the cab roof, letting them know she&#x2019;d made the speech. The engine began to rumble, and we lurched out of the yard.<br> <br>As we were leaving Segundo Mexia, I spotted Freedom walking by the side of the road and gave him a yell. At the sight of the truck, he took off his hat and waved it at his mother, who raised her hand in farewell.<br> <br>&#x201c;See you soon, son!&#x201d; she called.<br> <br>I could feel the farm people&#x2019;s eyes going from the boy to his mother. The two were not exactly the same color. Galilee had gotten pregnant by the son of the landowner her parents worked for. Her parents had sacrificed to help Galilee run away. In Dixie, kids who didn&#x2019;t look like their black mothers were in for a very hard time.<br> <br>After many adventures, mostly bad, some good, Galilee had ended up in Segundo Mexia. But along the way, she&#x2019;d learned to shoot. She had a skill. I trusted her with my life.<br> <br>We were on a good part of the road, one that hadn&#x2019;t been broken. There were still stretches around like that. My mother had told me that once almost all the roads were smooth, and t...</p><h2>John Brown: His Fight for Freedom</h2><p>Published on the 150th anniversary of John Brown&#x2019;s raid on Harpers Ferry, this biography explores the life of one of American history&#x2019;s most controversial figures.

Pornography seriously misrepresents how women feel about sex and themselves. "It amazes me," says <i>Great Sex</i> advisory board member Dennis Sugrue, Ph.D., "how some men don't understand that pornography presents a fantasy world, a Neverland that's very different from the world real people live in." Some fantasies it promotes: <b>Fantasy:</b> Every woman can't wait to spread her legs. <b>Reality:</b> In real life, compared with men, women usually need considerably more sexual warm-up time before they feel comfortable with genital sexuality. They need time for playful, creative, full-body sensuality. Porn totally ignores this very real need. Instead, it encourages men to plunge into intercourse long before women feel receptive. When surveys ask women what they dislike about the way men make love, they consistently reply that men rush into intercourse too quickly. Blame it on porn. Porn sex leaves many women cold -- and turned-off women aren't much fun in bed. <b>Fantasy:</b> A woman should look like a porn star to be considered sexy. <b>Reality:</b> Porn stars' bodies are way too perfect. They have flat bellies; firm breasts, thighs, upper arms, and butts; no flab; and no wrinkles. Many have also had plastic surgery: breast enlargement, tummy tucks, liposuction -- you name it. "Many men don't understand how most women compare themselves to porn actresses," advisory board member Louanne Weston, Ph.D., explains. "The typical woman feels very distressed that her body is nowhere near as flawless as what she sees on screen. Her man is sitting there thinking, 'I'd love a blowjob like that.' Meanwhile she's thinking, 'I'm a tub of lard.' When women see the men in their lives enjoying those women they often feel hopelessly outclassed. They fear rejection, and it's a deep and chilling fear, one few men appreciate." <b>Fantasy:</b> Women love to flaunt their bodies. <b>Reality:</b> The women in porn seem delighted to flash their breasts and genitals, and strut around naked just about anywhere. Few real women are exhibitionists. Because of their insecurities about their bodies, many women feel reluctant to reveal themselves even to the men they love. Meanwhile, men who view porn often expect their lovers to prance around in the buff and can't understand why they insist on wearing robes until just before slipping under the covers and want the lights off during sex. <b>Fantasy:</b> Women are content to "receive" sex from men, with no hope of experiencing orgasm themselves. <b>Reality: </b>Given that fewer than half of women express orgasm during intercourse, the fact that women in pornography almost never do is actually the X-rated media's only realistic element. After the man comes, known in the industry as the "money shot," the sex is over. The women scream and moan in the throes of supposed passion, but they almost never have orgasms. Imagine if the roles were reversed and you were in the throes of ecstasy only to be cut short once your lover had her orgasm. You'd likely feel disappointed. When women watch porn, that's how many of them feel. The culture of porn has little interest in women's sexual satisfaction -- most is produced by men for men. In addition, given the rushed, nonsensual nature of porn sex, under those circumstances, it's a rare woman who could come, even if she wanted to. No wonder so many men are in the dark about women's orgasms. They never see them in porn, and they have no idea that porn-style sex leaves many women so turned off and unfulfilled that they can't possibly express orgasm. <b>Fantasy:</b> All women respond the same way in bed. <b>Reality: </b>Pornography ignores the unique individuality of sexual expression. Porn sex is cookbook sex. Take two people. Get them naked. She sucks. He licks. Then they have intercourse in various acrobatic -- and unrealistic -- positions. Some people may enjoy making love this way, but most prefer more creativity. Porn never shows lovers massaging each other's shoulders, or running fingers through each other's hair, or tracing fingers on the backs of knees, or sucking each other's fingers or ear lobes. All of these little moves add special zing to lovemaking. Pornography rarely shows eye contact, never zooms in to catch one lover whispering, "I love you." Nor does pornography ever show lovers asking each other, "Is this okay? How's this? Too light? Just right? Too intense?" Or "What can I do for you?" In porn, one script fits all. "Porn sex is very narrow," Klein says. "After a while, it gets boring. Great sex never gets boring."

In this remarkable retelling, Thomas Fleming takes the reader into the post-revolutionary world of 1804, a chaotic and fragile time in the young country as well as a time of tremendous global instability.The success of the French Revolution and the proclamation of Napoleon as First Consul for Life had enormous impact on men like Hamilton and Burr, feeding their own political fantasies at a time of perceived Federal government weakness and corrosion. Their hunger for fame spawned antagonisms that wreaked havoc on themselves and their families and threatened to destabilize the fragile young American republic. From that poisonous brew came the tangle of regret and anger and ambition that drove the two to their murderous confrontation in Weehawken, New Jersey.Readers will find this is popular narrative history at its most authoritative, and authoritative history at its most readable.</p><p>To judge by many standard histories, the revolutionary founders of the United States came equipped with wings and haloes. They were anything but saintly, however; their behavior, public and private, was often scandalous. One of the most outrageous men of the day was Alexander Hamilton, the Federalist leader and architect of the American banking and judiciary systems, whose amorous exploits and political maneuverings alike were the stuff of legend. Tangled in a succession of failed business ventures and personal intrigues, and convinced that the might of the United States should not be hampered by such inconveniences as checks and balances, Hamilton fell afoul of just about everyone he encountered in his quest for influence and wealth.<p> To his eventual misfortune, one of those he crossed was Thomas Jefferson's vice president, Aaron Burr. Many histories of their tangled relationship personalize their differences, and, to be sure, they disliked each other with splendid fervor. Thomas Fleming's contribution to the often-told tale is to ground the Hamilton-Burr rivalry in the politics of the day--a politics complicated by many contending ideological factions, powerful interest groups, and lobbyists. Writing with vigor and clarity, Fleming points to the clay feet on which Hamilton and Burr marched to their sad destiny, and he crafts an exceptionally interesting portrait of the early Republic. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Thomas Fleming</b> is the author of more than forty books, including <i>The New Dealers' War, Duel</i>, and <i>Liberty! The American Revolution</i>, as well as best-selling novels about America's war experience such as <i>Time and Tide</i> and <i>The Officers' Wives</i>.

Tour.</p><p>Although Mailer relies heavily on previous Picasso biographies and memoirs, from which he quotes extensively, this inspired, lavishly illustrated biography offers an uncanny psychological portrait of Picasso's inner development as man and artist. Commenting on 250 black-and-white and 55 color reproductions woven throughout the text, the prolific author presents Picasso as a painter who was wholly derivative until his Blue Period, and who then harnessed his inner terrors, his dread of mental and physical destruction, as a stimulus to his work. Mailer considers Cubism, and Picasso's related discoveries between 1907 and 1917, as his creative peak, from which he would beat a retreat by the late 1920s. This elegantly written portrait, which makes Picasso's erotic drawings and paintings an integral part of the story, mixes shrewd insights, wild psychosexual speculations, anecdotes and telling incidents. The narrative, which closes on the eve of WWI, pays special attention to Picasso's relationships with his mistress, Fernande Olivier (whose untranslated memoirs, written in her 70s, Mailer excerpts in chunks); and with Gertrude Stein, Guillaume Apollinaire and Picasso's sexually impotent friend, aesthete Carlos Casagemas, who committed suicide in 1901, dejected over unrequited love for a model. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Following hard on the heels of <i>Oswald's Tale</i> , this "personal interpretation" of the first third of Picasso's life finds Mailer in fine mettle, pleased as can be to complete a project he began but put aside some 30 years ago. It makes perfect sense that Mailer would identify so strongly and intuitively with Picasso: they share many traits, in terms of talent and personality. In fact, Mailer feels so connected to Picasso, he offers all kinds of daring theories about the sources of his revolutionary aesthetic and high-handed life. Freely admitting that he conducted no "original scholarship," Mailer makes liberal use of the work of his many predecessors, even, in the case of John Richardson, who's working on a magisterial multivolume biography of the artist, offering strong criticism of their analysis. His favorite source is not a scholar, but rather Fernande Olivier, with whom Picasso had his first serious relationship. Fernande's memoirs haven't yet been published in English, but Mailer quotes her at length, and these passages make for revelatory and intriguing reading. As his fascination with Fernande suggests, Mailer's main avenue of interpretation of Picasso's genius is a sexual one, and he has some striking things to say about Picasso's obsession with carnality and the awesome power of women. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Gnomes Book of Christmas Crafts</h2><p>Step-by-step instructions with patterns and diagrams for more than 50 gnome-inspired Christmas decorations and crafts.</p><p></p><h2>Old Testament Wisdom Literature: A Theological Introduction</h2><p>The books of Job, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are rooted in the order created by the one true God. Their steady gaze penetrates to the very nature of created reality and leads us toward peace and human flourishing. Craig Bartholomew and Ryan O'Dowd tune our ears to hear once again Lady Wisdom calling in the streets. <em>Old Testament Wisdom Literature</em> provides an informed introduction to the Old Testament wisdom books Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Job. Establishing the books in the context of ancient Near Eastern wisdom traditions and literature, the authors move beyond the scope of typical introductions to discuss the theological and hermeneutical implications of this literature.</p><p>"Clear, accessible and insightful. Bartholomew and O'Dowd have teamed up to produce an introduction to the theology of wisdom that will not only inform the readers' minds but encourage their spiritual development as well. Great for classroom use." (Tremper Longman, Robert H. Gundry Professor of Biblical Studies, Westmont College)<br><br>"For an introductory level book, there are rich pickings to be found in<em> Old Testament Wisdom Literature</em>! The tone of the book is accessible enough to make it an appealing and stimulating experience for any 'reading Christian,' but there are also depths here to engage even the most seasoned student of the Old Testament's Wisdom literature. The key to this book's success is in its title--it is truly a <em>theological</em> introduction, and this sets it apart from other introductory volumes to the Wisdom literature. Careful explanation of critical issues regarding Proverbs, Job and Ecclesiastes is followed by close readings of specific texts and consideration of their lasting theological significance. And the concluding chapters on Jesus as the Wisdom of God, and the theology of the Wisdom literature both in the original and in today's context are, quite simply, masterful. If you want to 'get wisdom' (Proverbs 4:5), then this book will be a tremendously helpful companion for the journey." (Jamie Grant, vice principal, Highland Theological College)<br><br>"Be not misled: this is much more than a theological introduction to the Old Testament wisdom books. It is a wide-ranging survey of their significance against their ancient Middle Eastern background and in the context of modern study. It stresses and explicates their poetic nature, and it makes illuminating links with modern and postmodern thinking." (John Goldingay, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Craig Bartholomew and Ryan O'Dowd have given the church a theology of Wisdom literature that is like apples of gold in settings of silver. Its apples of gold are its profound, penetrating and accurate insights into Old Testament wisdom. These are set in the silver settings of discerning evaluations, an engaging style, and the best of ancient and modern scholarship."

I recall absolutely nothing about my exceptionally murky origins ... but I know well that for a long cold while I was perfectly mute and only slightly more conscious than stone, sliding through the emptiest, blackest reaches of space, my only persistent thought telling me that I was to do nothing but wait ... wait for something wondrous, or something awful ... wait for some little event or a knowing voice that would help answer those questions that I could barely ask of myself ... .</i><i>For aeons and a day, I felt remarkably, painfully tiny. Drifting through the cosmos, I imagined myself as a substantial but otherwise ordinary species of cosmic dust. Compared to the vastness, I was nothing. How could I believe otherwise? Unobserved, I passed through intricate walls woven from newborn galaxies--magnificent hot swirls of suns and glowing dust, each revolving around some little black prick of collapsed Creation--and among that splendor, I was simply a nameless speck, a twist of random grit moving at an almost feeble speed, my interior unlit and profoundly cold, my leading face battered and slowly eroded by the endless rain of lesser dusts.</i><i>Through space and through time, I drifted.</i><i>Galaxies grew scarce, and the void was deeper and ever colder ... and when I might have believed that I would never touch sunlight again ... when my fate seemed to be blackness and the endless silence ... I</i> <i>found myself falling toward a modest disk of stars and dust and little living worlds ... .</i><i>By chance, a young species--the human species--noticed me while I was still descending through the outskirts of their Milky Way. Brave as fools and bold asgods, they built an armada of swift little ships and raced out to meet me, and to my utter amazement, I discovered that I was enormous--bigger than worlds, massive and enduring, and in their spellbound eyes, beautiful.</i><i>Humans were the first species to walk upon my face, and with a quick and efficient thoroughness, they explored my hollow places. To prove my considerable worth, they fought a little war to retain their hold on me. According to law and practicality, I was salvage, and I was theirs. In careful stages, they began to wake me, rousing my ancient reactors, my vast engines and life-support systems, repairing the damage left by my long, long sleep. And they gave me my first true voice--in a fashion. A thousand mouths were grafted on to me. Radio dishes and powerful lasers, neutrino beacons and spinning masses of degenerate matter endowed me with the power to shout at every approaching sun and all the living worlds. "Here I am," I would announce. "See me! Study me! Know me, then come visit me!" In a multitude of languages, my new mouths claimed, "I hunger for your company, your friendship, and your infinite trust." I asked, "Are you, like so many technological species, a func-tional immortal?" Then I promised, "For a fair fee, I will carry your ageless and precious soul to a distant world. Or in half a million years, after circumnavigating the Milky Way, I will bring you home again. Can you imagine a greater, more ennobling adventure than to journey once around our galaxy? Or for a still greater payment, I can become your permanent home--a vast, ever-changing realm offering more novelty and sheer wonder than any other body in Creation." Then with a barker's teasing laugh, I would ask, "What kind of immortal would you be if you didn't wish for such a splendid, endless fate ...</i> ?"<i>Like every proud child, I spoke obsessively about myself. Addressing species that I had never met, I defined my terms and described my dimensions, my depths, and my laudable talents. I was lovely igneous stone and ancient iron buttressed with hyperfiber bones, and my skin was a thick armor of high-grade hyperfiber capable of shruggingoff the impacts of interstellar gravel and full-bodied comets. I was swimming through the Milky Way at one-third the velocity of unencumbered light. My engines were as big as moons, and I was bigger than most of my patrons' home worlds: twenty Earth masses, and fifty thousand kilometers in diameter, with a hull covering nearly eight billion square kilometers. But my skin was nothing compared to my spongelike meat. Whoever built me had the foresight to give me endless arrays of wide caverns and neat tunnels, underground seas and chambers too numerous to be counted. I could conjure up any climate, replicate any odd biosphere. To travelers who appreciate robust numbers, I spat out an impressive figure. "Twenty trillion cubic kilometers." That was the combined volume of my hollow places. On a simple world such as the Earth--a world I will never see, except perhaps in passing--there are barely 200 million square kilometers of living space. Life exists in two dimensions, not three; trees and buildings reach only so high. Only the top fringe of the ocean and the little zones by the rifting plates are productive habitats. "Not with me," I said with a seamless arrogance. My new voice was designed to sound prideful, sharp, and confident. "With me, every little room is a potential paradise. I can give you the perfect illusion of any sunlight and the exact atmosphere that you find most pleasant, unless you need a hard vacuum, which I can achieve just as easily. I can manufacture soils to fit the most delicate chemistry and fluids enough to slake any thirst, and by an assortment of means, you can wander through my public areas--my shops and auditoriums, religious sites and scenic vistas--unless it is your preference to live entirely by yourself, which is your right. If solitude is your nature, I will honor your noble choice.</i><i>"I accept all species," I claimed. Which was true, to a degree. I would welcome every sentient soul, but my ageless human captains always retained the final word. My voice never entirely mentioned the possibility that travelers could come some great distance, and at no smallrisk to themselves, only to be informed that they could not afford passage, or less likely, that they were deemed too unstable or too dangerous to be allowed to live among my more docile passengers.</i><i>Always, always, I sang endless praises of my human caretakers. They were my captains, my engineers, my guiding hands and crafty fingers. They owned me, I admitted with a voice that couldn't have sounded more thrilled. Better than any other species, the humans knew my depths, understood my potentials, and were fully prepared to hold tight to me until the end of Creation.</i><i>Perhaps I believed those boastful words, but my truest feelings remained secret, even from myself.</i><i>I am rich in many things, but particularly in those things that are unknown.</i>&nbsp;<br><i>Washen was one of the first children born inside me, and that earliest little portion of her considerable life was spent in a modest house overlooking one of my warm blue seas. Her loving parents were engineers, by training and by deepest conviction, meaning that not only did they know how to build every possible structure and every conceivable machine, they also possessed the clear, un-sentimental, and pragmatic outlook of true engineers: The universe-their universe-was rich with an elegant beauty, known elements and reliable forces playing against each other in ancient, proven ways. If there were questions of consequence needing to be solved-a dubious possibility, at best--then those questions didn't involve people of their particular caliber. Engineering was a finished profession. The galaxy was adorned with many wise old species that long ago had mastered Nature's basic tricks. Humans were virtual newcomers. With nothing but science and intuition to guide them, human engineers had managed to teach themselves how to build lasers and fusion reactors and bioceramic materials. Given time, they might have invented much of the rest of what was possible. But during their twenty-first century, a moon-boundobservatory glanced at a particularly rich portion of the sky, for a few perfect moments, intercepting a tight-beamed broadcast from a distant civilization that was bound for an even more distant world.</i><i>Inside that dense and highly structured burst of blue light were enough tricks and fancies to fuel a dozen intellectual revolutions. Hyperfiber was perhaps the greatest of the alien gifts. Built from deceptively ordinary materials, it was a lightweight and potentially immortal substance that could endure almost any abuse, and do so while shouldering almost any burden.</i><i>There were many reasons not to expect to find a great ship wandering on the fringes of the Milky Way. But no competent engineer was surprised to learn that my skin and bones were composed of hyperfiber. What else would a godly power employ in such an enormous construction? Perhaps my particular hyperfiber was a better grade than what people and most other species had cultured in the past, or even in the brilliant present. And yes, the scale and perfection of my spherical body demanded resources and quality controls that not even a thousand worlds working together could achieve. But nothing about me seemed genuinely impossible, much less threatening to the status quo. Yes, I was grand and highly unlikely, and marvelous, and enigmatic, but I still resided firmly in the grasp of an engineer's venerable, often-proved theories.</i><i>When Washen was a young girl, her parents helped first culture the finer grades of hyperfiber, using my hull's armor as their inspiration. They taught themselves to do the magic in sufficient quantities to patch my old craters and the occasional deep wound. Their house was littered with scraps and useless shards--failed experiments brought home from the factories--and sometimes Washen would pick up one of the bright pieces, staring at her own reflection. She was a slender girl, a pretty girl, a little tall for her age, her black hair worn long and oftentimes damp from swimming in the sea. Even though she was the offspring of deeply committed engineers, she lacked theirnarrow curiosity. One day while sitting at the breakfast table and staring at a ball of sweet new hyperfiber, she suddenly inquired, "Where did this come from?"</i><i>Her father was a handsome man, young-faced but in his second millennium of life, and even on his most poetic day, he was a literal soul. With a calm, studied voice, he explained what was obvious and essential. A nanoscale foundation was laid down in the factory. Each atom had to be doctored before it was set in its perfect space, aligned with its neighbors, then every quark allowed to find its perfect resonance. Then if a certain standard was achieved, the entire batch was turned into a quasi fluid, thick and gray and ready to fill molds or one of the ancient craters scattered across the ship's hull. The material's final grade depended on subtle, oftentimes invisible, factors. Unfair as it seemed, luck played a powerful role. But he didn't wish to bore his daughter with dense technical terms. Using a few convoluted sentences, he had answered her question, adding, "That's where this comes from," as he gestured at a mirror-faced ball barely bigger than the hand that was holding it.</i><i>Washen nodded agreeably. Her question had been answered, if not in the manner she had hoped. There was no reason to act rude or complain. No, she realized the best course was to turn in her chair, turn and smile, and ask her mother the same essential question.</i><i>"Where did we get this?"</i><i>Washen's mother had different gifts, different strengths. She was very much an engineer, but she possessed a more rarefied appreciation for theory and high mathematics. Quietly and with a seamless patience, the woman explained. "We call it hyperfiber for good straightforward reasons. The name refers to the hyperdimensions that we can't actually see. Dimensions other than up or over or back. Dimensions other than time, which isn't a true dimension anyway. You see, it takes eleven dimensions to build the universe. Or thirteen. Or twelve. The exact number depends on which Theory of All you happen to subscribeto. But in every important way, the answers are the same. Some of these invisible dimensions are enormous and others are quite tiny, and what you are holding there ... that very tiny piece of hyperfiber ... well, its fibers stretch into these other dimensions, both physically and through deep subtle forces ... ."</i><i>The full lecture continued for a long while. The woman could be pleasantly loquacious, and Washen accepted her mother's nature just as she accepted the fact that she couldn't understand what was being said. But she nodded politely. She sometimes smiled. When bored, she looked at her own skeptical reflection. Perhaps she had thought her question was very simple, and it plainly wasn't simple, and how could she make herself understood?</i><i>"When you strike a piece of hyperfiber," her mother continued, "the impact forces don't spread just through our three dimensions, no. They dissipate through all eleven of them. Or thirteen. Or twelve. Or twenty-three. There are approximately seven distinct universal theories. Your father and I like the eleven-dimension theory, but all give the same conclusion: Even when hyperfiber fractures, a quantum echo lingers in the upper-dimensional realms. What you're holding there ... it's really a much larger object than you can see. It extends out into every corner of the universe, in all of its manifestations, and even if you could grind that ball down to dust, the ball remains intact. If only as a theory, of course. As a delicious mathematical concept existing in the shadow realms--"</i><i>"No," the young girl blurted, finally interrupting.</i><i>Offended, her mother stiffly asked, "What is the matter, dear?"</i><i>"What's wrong?" the old man growled. "Darling, you're talking nonsense, that's what's the matter. The girl's barely half-grown, and what are you doing? Jabbering about quantum mechanics and ghostly physics ... !"</i><i>"I know she's young."</i><i>"Hell," he said. "Your song barely makes sense to me. And I passed the same classes you passed"</i><i>"You didn't have my grades," her mother countered.</i><i>"Who remembers that?" he snarled. "Besides you, I mean."</i><i>There was an ugly, much-practiced pause, then a gnawing discomfort. It was unseemly to argue in front of a child, even one of your own. The two old people stared at each other, making their apologies with the tiniest of winks, and into that silence came the stubborn voice of someone demanding an answer to her insistent little question.</i><i>"Where did this come from?" Washen repeated.</i><i>Then she explained, "I don't mean how we cook it up, or why it works. I just want to know where we got it in the first place."</i><i>"Oh," her parents said, with a shared voice.</i><i>"Hyperfiber was a gift," Father replied "An accidental gift from an alien civilization."</i><i>"The Sag-7 signal gave us the essential recipe," Mother added.</i><i>Washen shook her head.</i><i>"I know that much," she promised. "That's history, and I got that in school, plenty of times already."</i><i>With genuine confusion, her parents asked what she really meant.</i><i>Washen concentrated, her chocolate-colored eyes r...</i></p><h2>Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919</h2><p>Written with the sweep of an epic novel and grounded in extensive research into contemporary documents, Savage Peace is a striking portrait of American democracy under stress. It is the surprising story of America in the year 1919.</p><p><b>Book Description</b><br>Written with the sweep of an epic novel and grounded in extensive research into contemporary documents, <i>Savage Peace</i> is a striking portrait of American democracy under stress. It is the surprising story of America in the year 1919. <p>In the aftermath of an unprecedented worldwide war and a flu pandemic, Americans began the year full of hope, expecting to reap the benefits of peace. But instead, the fear of terrorism filled their days. Bolshevism was the new menace, and the federal government, utilizing a vast network of domestic spies, began to watch anyone deemed suspicious. A young lawyer named J. Edgar Hoover headed a brand-new intelligence division of the Bureau of Investigation (later to become the FBI). Bombs exploded on the doorstep of the attorney general's home in Washington, D.C., and 36 parcels containing bombs were discovered at post offices across the country. Poet and journalist Carl Sandburg, recently returned from abroad with a trunk full of Bolshevik literature, was detained in New York, his trunk seized. A 21-year-old Russian girl living in New York was sentenced to 15 years in prison for protesting U.S. intervention in Arctic Russia, where thousands of American soldiers remained after the Armistice, ostensibly to guard supplies but in reality to join a British force meant to be a warning to the new Bolshevik government. </p><p>In 1919, wartime legislation intended to curb criticism of the government was extended and even strengthened. Labor strife was a daily occurrence. And decorated African-American soldiers, returning home to claim the democracy for which they had risked their lives, were badly disappointed. Lynchings continued, race riots would erupt in 26 cities before the year ended, and secret agents from the government's "Negro Subversion" unit routinely shadowed outspoken African-Americans. </p><p> </p><p>Adding a vivid human drama to the greater historical narrative, <i>Savage Peace</i> brings 1919 alive through the people who played a major role in making the year so remarkable. Among them are William Monroe Trotter, who tried to put democracy for African-Americans on the agenda at the Paris peace talks; Supreme Court associate justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who struggled to find a balance between free speech and legitimate government restrictions for reasons of national security, producing a memorable decision for the future of free speech in America; and journalist Ray Stannard Baker, confidant of President Woodrow Wilson, who watched carefully as Wilson's idealism crumbled and wrote the best accounts we have of the president's frustration and disappointment. </p><p>Weaving together the stories of a panoramic cast of characters, from Albert Einstein to Helen Keller, Ann Hagedorn brilliantly illuminates America at a pivotal moment. </p> <b>An Exclusive Note to Readers from Ann Hagedorn</b> <br><br><i>Savage Peace</i> is the biography of the year 1919 in America told through interweaving narratives that connect the reader to the individuals, events and themes that make the year so hugely significant. My quest is always to make history as accessible as possible to the general public using storytelling techniques and so I structured <i>Savage Peace</i> like a work of fiction with main characters and story arcs. It is, however, based firmly on facts gleaned from primary sources housed in archives nationwide, including declassified military intelligence and justice department records. I spent more than five years researching and writing the book in an effort of course to get to the very core of the significance of the year 1919 and to deliver that truth to you, the reader, in an entertaining style. <p>But why 1919? First, I consider the year a missing page in our history. We typically associate 1919 with the Paris Peace Conference, Woodrow Wilson and the League of Nations--all important aspects of the year, of course. But there is far more to the year than what happened in Paris. In fact, <i>Savage Peace</i> tells the story of what happened in America while Wilson was in Paris. Remember that 1919 was the aftermath of a world war, a flu pandemic, and the Russian Revolution. It was an uncertain, very intense year that shaped policies and attitudes for nearly a century in America. In many respects it was the year that made modern America. Consider that the foundation of our domestic intelligence system was firmly established in 1919; that our "cold" relationship with the Soviet Union emerged from events such as U.S. intervention in north Russia that year and the government&#x2019;s raid on the Soviet Bureau in Manhattan; and that our response to the 1919 race riots (in 26 cities) was to use segregation as the solution instead of identifying it as the problem. One of the things that drew me to the year was that it offers us all an opportunity to observe democracy under extreme duress. This was a time when Americans were caught between the promise of democracy&#x2013;-Wilson told us we were fighting the war to make the world safe for democracy--and the penalties for exercising democratic rights at home in the aftermath of the war. After the Armistice, certain wartime measures and laws were kept in place in the name of protecting the nation from the new threat of Bolshevism. This allowed the nation to stay immersed in the mentality of war, the culture of fear, and a state of perpetual crisis, which in turn justified an attack on Democratic rights and raised the issue of the delicate balance between national security and the safety of the constitution. </p><p>During World War I, a massive domestic intelligence system was put in place to protect Americans on their own soil, to outsmart German spies, and to identify German sympathizers. It was indeed the largest corps of homeland spies ever assembled in any nation during wartime and it included at least 300,000 volunteer spies in organizations such as the American Protective League, the National Security League, the Liberty League, the Home Defense League, the Sedition Slammers, and the Boy Spies of America. There were wartime laws too, such as the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it a crime to obstruct the war and to criticize the war, and among other things, gave the postmaster general the right to censor "seditious" magazines and newspapers. The Sedition Act in 1918 (an amended version of the Espionage Act) went further and said it was a crime to "willfully utter, print, write or publish" any expression of disloyalty toward or criticism of the U.S. government, its Constitution, its flag, or its military uniforms. </p><p>In 1919, these laws and the domestic intelligence network were still in tact. Now the task was to identify those who favored leniency for Germany in the ensuing peace negotiations and, as the Justice Dept. told the Washington Post on Armistice Day, to keep a "vigilant watch over anarchists, plotters and aliens." Soon dissent in America was bundled into one package labeled Bolshevism. Hiram Johnson, the Republican senator from California who was loudly speaking out against U.S. intervention in north Russia&#x2013;-a military adventure unauthorized and in fact unknown by most Congressmen and one that evolved into a civil war in which we were fighting with the White Army against the Reds--said in one of his speeches to the U.S. Senate, "It is a dangerous and delicate thing to speak of Russia and to even inquire concerning our activities there. During the war it became fashionable to call all who disagreed with any governmental policy pro-German. Now the fashion has changed: and any man who will not accept the wrongful edict of entrenched power is by that token a Bolsheviki." </p><p>In <i>Savage Peace</i> I show that one of the people who best understood just how hard it would be to free the nation and the Constitution from the emergency restrictions put in place during the war was Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., then an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. In March of 1919 he issued an opinion saying effectively that the right of free speech could be taken away if the speech or circular contained wording that presented a "clear and present danger" of causing unlawful acts. His critics argued that expression could not be censored on the basis of the possibility that it might incite such acts as the acts could be punished when and if they occurred. </p><p>That summer and autumn Holmes reconsidered the limitations and the protections of free speech in America. And in November, he modified his view in a dissenting opinion that expanded the definition of protected speech in America. In that opinion he wrote: "When men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas&#x2013;-that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market... We should be eternally vigilant against the attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death, unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purpose of the law that an immediate check is required to save the country." </p><p>Fortunately, Holmes' words outlived the hysteria of the year in which he wrote them. So did Democracy. </p><p>There is so very much more I could say about the importance of 1919, especially about what we can learn from that year. <i>Savage Peace</i> is as the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> wrote in its great review of the book "a potent reminder of the fragility of civil liberties and the power of conspiratorial fantasies propagated by true believers and opportunists alike during times of war and uncertainty." </p><p>Looking at the year 1919 indeed reminds us to listen to the voices in America's past who well understood that Democracy has the capability of correcting its errors only as long as its citizens can exercise their rights. I'd like to end this note to my readers with the words of one of the individuals portrayed in <i>Savage Peace</i>, New York attorney Harry Weinberger, who often represented people charged with violating the Espionage Act: "Democracy lives on the exercise and functioning of democracy. As a child learns and grows by doing, a people learn democracy by acting in democratic ways. I know from the history of other countries that even the best democratic constitutions did not prevent dictatorships unless the people were trained in democracy and held themselves eternally vigilant and ready to oppose all infringements on liberty." </p><p>Thanks for reading and enjoy the book! </p><p><i>--Ann Hagedorn</i> <br><br> </p><b>Ann Hagedorn</b>, an award-winning author and journalist, has been a staff writer for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and has written for other publications, including <i>The Washington Post</i>.

Hinson describes the Sunbonnets - pattern figures (often of small children) with large, face-hiding bonnets or straw hats. Quilters have long cherished traditional &#39;Sunbonnet Sue,&#39; and now they can be introduced (or reintroduced) to her equally appealing brothers and sisters. The Sunbonnets have followed fashions over the years, and the result is a fascinating group of patterns that reflect successive styles in American costume and design. Quilters will find it delightfully difficult to choose from this treasury of Sunbonnet Babies, Dutch Dolls,and Colonial Ladies (and Men). All designs are given as full-sized patterns in a variety of block sizes, and almost all have 12-inch blocks that can be combined in a sampler Sunbonnet quilt. Detailed instructions show quilters how to use the patterns to create beautiful quilts. But these charming figures are as much at home on children&#39;s clothing and such items as embroidered linens as they are gracing a quilt. Eight pages of color photogrpahs illustrate some of the ways quilters have found to bring the Sunbonnet Family into their own lives.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Wonder Woman</h2><p>Nice collection of classic Wonder Woman comic stories.</p><p></p><h2>Foundation and earth</h2><p>The fifth novel in Asimov&#39;s popular Foundation series opens with second thoughts. Councilman Golan Trevize is wondering if he was right to choose a collective mind as the best possible future for humanity over the anarchy of contentious individuals, nations and planets. To test his conclusion, he decides he must know the past and goes in search of legendary Earth, all references to which have been erased from galactic libraries. The societies encountered along the way become arguing points in a book-long colloquy about man&#39;s fate, conducted by Trevize and traveling companion Bliss, who is part of the first world/mind, Gaia.</p><p>Isaac Asimov began his Foundation Series at the age of twenty-one, not realizing that it would one day be considered a cornerstone of science fiction. During his legendary career, Asimov penned over 470 books on subjects ranging from science to Shakespeare to history, though he was most loved for his award-winning science fiction sagas, which include the Robot, Empire, and Foundation series. Named a Grand Master of Science Fiction by the Science Fiction Writers of America, Asimov entertained and educated readers of all ages for close to five decasdes. He died, at age of seventy-two, in April 1992.1<br><br>THE SEARCH BEGINS<br>1.<br><br>"Why did I do it?" asked Golan Trevize.<br><br>It wasn't a new question. Since he had arrived at Gaia, he had asked it of himself frequently. He would wake up from a sound sleep in the pleasant coolness of the night and find the question sounding noiselessly in his mind, like a tiny drumbeat: Why did I do it? Why did I do it?<br><br>Now, though, for the first time, he managed to ask it of Dom, the ancient of Gaia.<br><br>Dom was well aware of Trevize's tension for he could sense the fabric of the Councilman's mind. He did not respond to it. Gaia must in no way ever touch Trevize's mind, and the best way of remaining immune to the temptation was to painstakingly ignore what he sensed.<br><br>"Do what, Trev?" he asked. He found it difficult to use more than one syllable in addressing a person, and it didn't matter. Trevize was growing somewhat used to that.<br><br>"The decision I made," said Trevize. "Choosing Gaia as the future."<br><br>"You were right to do so," said Dom, seated, his aged deep-set eyes looking earnestly up at the man of the Foundation, who was standing.<br><br>"You say I am right," said Trevize impatiently.<br><br>"I/we/Gaia know you are. That's your worth to us. You have the capacity for making the right decision on incomplete data, and you have made the decision. You chose Gaia! You rejected the anarchy of a Galactic Empire built on the technology of the First Foundation, as well as the anarchy of a Galactic Empire built on the mentalics of the Second Foundation. You decided that neither could be long stable. So you chose Gaia."<br><br>"Yes," said Trevize. "Exactly! I chose Gaia, a superorganism; a whole planet with a mind and personality in common, so that one has to say 'I/we/Gaia' as an invented pronoun to express the inexpressible." He paced the floor restlessly. "And it will become eventually Galaxia, a super-superorganism embracing all the swarm of the Milky Way."<br><br>He stopped, turned almost savagely on Dom, and said, "I feel I'm right, as you feel it, but you want the coming of Galaxia, and so are satisfied with the decision. There's something in me, however, that doesn't want it, and for that reason I'm not satisfied to accept the rightness so easily. I want to know why I made the decision, I want to weigh and judge the rightness and be satisfied with it. Merely feeling right isn't enough. How can I know I am right? What is the device that makes me right?"<br><br>"I/we/Gaia do not know how it is that you come to the right decision. Is it important to know that as long as we have the decision?"<br><br>"You speak for the whole planet, do you? For the common consciousness of every dewdrop, of every pebble, of even the liquid central core of the planet?"<br><br>"I do, and so can any portion of the planet in which the intensity of the common consciousness is great enough."<br><br>"And is all this common consciousness satisfied to use me as a black box? Since the black box works, is it unimportant to know what is inside? --That doesn't suit me. I don't enjoy being a black box. I want to know what's inside. I want to know how and why I chose Gaia and Galaxia as the future, so that I can rest and be at peace."<br><br>"But why do you dislike or distrust your decision so?"<br><br>Trevize drew a deep breath and said slowly, in a low and forceful voice, "Because I don't want to be part of a superorganism. I don't want to be a dispensable part to be done away with whenever the superorganism judges that doing away would be for the good of the whole."<br><br>Dom looked at Trevize thoughtfully. "Do you want to change your decision, then, Trev? You can, you know."<br><br>"I long to change the decision, but I can't do that merely because I dislike it. To do something now, I have to know whether the decision is wrong or right. It's not enough merely to feel it's right."<br><br>"If you feel you are right, you are right." Always that slow, gentle voice that somehow made Trevize feel wilder by its very contrast with his own inner turmoil.<br><br>Then Trevize said, in half a whisper, breaking out of the insoluble oscillation between feeling and knowing, "I must find Earth."<br><br>"Because it has something to do with this passionate need of yours to know?"<br><br>"Because it is another problem that troubles me unbearably and because I feel there is a connection between the two. Am I not a black box? I feel there is a connection. Isn't that enough to make you accept it as a fact?"<br><br>"Perhaps," said Dom, with equanimity.<br><br>"Granted it is now thousands of years--twenty thousand perhaps--since the people of the Galaxy have concerned themselves with Earth, how is it possible that we have all forgotten our planet of origin?"<br><br>"Twenty thousand years is a longer time than you realize. There are many aspects of the early Empire we know little of; many legends that are almost surely fictitious but that we keep repeating, and even believing, because of lack of anything to substitute. And Earth is older than the Empire."<br><br>"But surely there are some records. My good friend, Pelorat, collects myths and legends of early Earth; anything he can scrape up from any source. It is his profession and, more important, his hobby. Those myths and legends are all there are. There are no actual records, no documents."<br><br>"Documents twenty thousand years old? Things decay, perish, are destroyed through inefficiency or war."<br><br>"But there should be records of the records; copies, copies of the copies, and copies of the copies of the copies; useful material much younger than twenty millennia. They have been removed. The Galactic Library at Trantor must have had documents concerning Earth. Those documents are referred to in known historical records, but the documents no longer exist in the Galactic Library. The references to them may exist, but any quotations from them do not exist."<br><br>"Remember that Trantor was sacked a few centuries ago."<br><br>"The Library was left untouched. It was protected by the personnel of the Second Foundation. And it was those personnel who recently discovered that material related to Earth no longer exists. The material was deliberately removed in recent times. Why?" Trevize ceased his pacing and looked intently at Dom. "If I find Earth, I will find out what it is hiding--"<br><br>"Hiding?"<br><br>"Hiding or being hidden. Once I find that out, I have the feeling I will know why I have chosen Gaia and Galaxia over our individuality. Then, I presume, I will know, not feel, that I am correct, and if I am correct"--he lifted his shoulders hopelessly--"then so be it."<br><br>"If you feel that is so," said Dom, "and if you feel you must hunt for Earth, then, of course, we will help you do as much as we can. That help, however, is limited. For instance, I/we/Gaia do not know where Earth may be located among the immense wilderness of worlds that make up the Galaxy."<br><br>"Even so," said Trevize, "I must search. --Even if the endless powdering of stars in the Galaxy makes the quest seem hopeless, and even if I must do it alone."<br>2.<br>Trevize was surrounded by the tameness of Gaia. The temperature, as always, was comfortable, and the air moved pleasantly, refreshing but not chilling. Clouds drifted across the sky, interrupting the sunlight now and then, and, no doubt, if the water vapor level per meter of open land surface dropped sufficiently in this place or that, there would be enough rain to restore it.<br><br>The trees grew in regular spacings, like an orchard, and did so, no doubt, all over the world. The land and sea were stocked with plant and animal life in proper numbers and in the proper variety to provide an appropriate ecological balance, and all of them, no doubt, increased and decreased in numbers in a slow sway about the recognized optimum. --As did the number of human beings, too.<br><br>Of all the objects within the purview of Trevize's vision, the only wild card in the deck was his ship, the Far Star.<br><br>The ship had been cleaned and refurbished efficiently and well by a number of the human components of Gaia. It had been restocked with food and drink, its furnishings had been renewed or replaced, its mechanical workings rechecked. Trevize himself had checked the ship's computer carefully.<br><br>Nor did the ship need refueling, for it was one of the few gravitic ships of the Foundation, running on the energy of the general gravitational field of the Galaxy, and that was enough to supply all the possible fleets of humanity for all the eons of their likely existence without measurable decrease of intensity.<br><br>Three months ago, Trevize had been a Councilman of Terminus. He had, in other words, been a member of the Legislature of the Foundation and, ex officio, a great one of the Galaxy. Was it only three months ago? It seemed it was half his thirty-two-year-old lifetime since that had been his post and his only concern had been whether the great Seldon Plan had been valid or not; whether the smooth rise of the Foundation from planetary village to Galactic greatness had been properly charted in advance, or not.<br><br>Yet in some ways, there was no change. He was still a Councilman. His status and his privileges remained unchanged, except that he didn't expect he would ever return to Terminus to claim that status and those privileges. He would no more fit into the huge chaos of the Foundation than into the small orderliness of Gaia. He was at home nowhere, an orphan everywhere.<br><br>His jaw tightened and he pushed his fingers angrily through his black hair. Before he wasted time bemoaning his fate, he must find Earth. If he survived the search, there would then be time enough to sit down and weep. He might have even better reason then.<br><br>With determined stolidity, then, he thought back--<br><br>Three months before, he and Janov Pelorat, that able, naive scholar, had left Terminus. Pelorat had been driven by his antiquarian enthusiasms to discover the site of long-lost Earth, and Trevize had gone along, using Pelorat's goal as a cover for what he thought his own real aim was. They did not find Earth, but they did find Gaia, and Trevize had then found himself forced to make his fateful decision.<br><br>Now it was he, Trevize, who had turned half-circle--about-face--and was searching for Earth.<br><br>As for Pelorat, he, too, had found something he didn't expect. He had found the black-haired, dark-eyed Bliss, the young woman who was Gaia, even as Dom was--and as the nearest grain of sand or blade of grass was. Pelorat, with the peculiar ardor of late middle age, had fallen in love with a woman less than half his years, and the young woman, oddly enough, seemed content with that.<br><br>It was odd--but Pelorat was surely happy and Trevize thought resignedly that each person must find happiness in his or her own manner. That was the point of individuality--the individuality that Trevize, by his choice, was abolishing (given time) over all the Galaxy.<br><br>The pain returned. That decision he had made, and had had to make, continued to excoriate him at every moment and was--<br><br>"Golan!"<br><br>The voice intruded on Trevize's thoughts and he looked up in the direction of the sun, blinking his eyes.<br><br>"Ah, Janov," he said heartily--the more heartily because he did not want Pelorat guessing at the sourness of his thoughts. He even managed a jovial, "You've managed to tear yourself away from Bliss, I see."<br><br>Pelorat shook his head. The gentle breeze stirred his silky white hair, and his long solemn face retained its length and solemnity in full. "Actually, old chap, it was she that suggested I see you--about--about what I want to discuss. Not that I wouldn't have wanted to see you on my own, of course, but she seems to think more quickly than I do."<br><br>Trevize smiled. "It's all right, Janov. You're here to say good-bye, I take it."<br><br>"Well, no, not exactly. In fact, more nearly the reverse. Golan, when we left Terminus, you and I, I was intent on finding Earth. I've spent virtually my entire adult life at that task."<br><br>"And I will carry on, Janov. The task is mine now."<br><br>"Yes, but it's mine, also; mine, still."<br><br>"But--" Trevize lifted an arm in a vague all-inclusive gesture of the world about them.<br><br>Pelorat said, in a sudden urgent gasp, "I want to go with you."<br><br>Trevize felt astonished. "You can't mean that, Janov. You have Gaia now."<br><br>"I'll come back to Gaia someday, but I cannot let you go alone."<br><br>"Certainly you can. I can take care of myself."<br><br>"No offense, Golan, but you don't know enough. It is I who know the myths and legends. I can direct you."<br><br>"And you'll leave Bliss? Come, now."<br><br>A faint pink colored Pelorat's cheeks. "I don't exactly want to do that, old chap, but she said--"<br><br>Trevize frowned. "Is it that she's trying to get rid of you, Janov? She promised me--"<br><br>"No, you don't understand. Please listen to me, Golan. You do have this uncomfortable explosive way of jumping to conclusions before you hear one out. It's your specialty, I know, and I seem to have a certain difficulty in expressing myself concisely, but--"<br><br>"Well," said Trevize gently, "suppose you tell me exactly what it is that Bliss has on her mind in just any way you please, and I promise to be very patient."<br><br>"Thank you, and as long as you're going to be patient, I think I can come out with it right away. You see, Bliss wants to come, too."<br><br>"Bliss wants to come?" said Trevize. "No, I'm exploding again. I won't explode. Tell me, Janov, why would Bliss want to come along? I'm asking it quietly."<br><br>"She didn't say. She said she wants to talk to you."<br><br>"Then why isn't she here, eh?"<br><br>Pelorat said, "I think--I say I think--that she is rather of the opinion that you are not fond of her, Golan, and she rather hesitates to approach you. I have done my best, old man, to assure her that you have nothing against her. I cannot believe anyone would think anything but highly of her. Still, she wanted me to broach the subject with you, so to speak. May I tell her that you'll be willing to see her, Golan?"<br><br>"Of course, I'll see her right now."<br><br>"And you'll be reasonable? You see, old man, she's rather intense about it. She said the matter was vital and she must go with you."</p><h2>McQueen&#39;s Machines: The Cars and Bikes of a Hollywood Icon</h2><p><p>He made movies best remembered for their wild car chases, mad motorcycle dashes, and hair-raising races, but no one forgets the man at the wheel--Steve McQueen, the King of Cool.

In this first full biography of the beloved veterinarian and author, Graham Lord pays tribute to this remarkable man whose calm and reserve remained unchanged by phenomenal success and adulation. in color.</p><p>It&#39;s difficult to perform the straight narrative of a biography entertainingly, but Paul Michael does a good job by changing his accents on the few occasions when non-Herriot characters are quoted. His overall intonation is properly regional, and anyone who enjoyed All Creatures Great and Small would probably enjoy this audiobook. The book focuses on distinguishing between the lives of the pseudonymous James Herriot and his creator, veterinarian Alf Wight. There were many similarities and some differences, as when Wight made embellishments to his own life for interviewers. It&#39;s especially interesting to see how the fictional characters stack up against their real-life counterparts. D.W. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineA well-tempered, well-researched biography of the world's most famous veterinarian, from novelist Lord (God and All His Angels, 1997, etc.). After buying over 50 million copies of his books chronicling the gentle meanderings of a country vet, readers may feel they have a pretty good handle on the life of Alf Wight, a.k.a. James Herriot. Not so, claims Wight's good friend Lord, whose 1972 review of It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet in London's Sunday Express pushed Herriot to the forefront. According to Lord, the books are pretty much one part fact to two parts creative writing. As he details the life of Wight, from his boyhood in Glasgow to his death of prostate cancer in 1995, Lord never suggests that the vet was anything other than modest, self-effacing, and kind, or that the Yorkshire dales that Wight so magically evoked--``the sparkling streams, the birds calling in the huge silences, the wide-open spaces''--were anything less than cozy in the extreme. But he does want to set the record as straight as possible, fussing with dates, calling into suspicion various war stories spun by Wight, and unmasking the true personalities of Siegfried, Helen, Tristan, et al., none of whom shines under Lord's scrutiny. The author has unearthed plenty of nuggets, such as Wight's nervous breakdown, brought on by depression stemming from brucellosis (transmitted by infected pregnant cows), and the debt Wight owed to an ex-hairdresser from Pinner, and he also does a good job analyzing the simple, direct style Wight brought to his homey material, both in his own critique and in interviews with Wight's publishers and editors. Lord is a bit too bedazzled by the wealth Wight amassed and seems obsessed with the vet's denying that he kept a diary when he obviously did, but otherwise he sticks to the facts, and his ocassional conjectures feel plausable. Doubtless this biography will be a feast for the Herriot hordes. (photos) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Nonetheless, it spurred the most significant buildup of military contingency this country has ever known: from the bunkers of Greenbrier, West Virginia, to the &#34;proving grounds&#34; of Nevada, where entire cities were built only to be vaporized. The Cold War was waged on a territory that knew no boundaries but left few traces. In this fascinating--and at turns frightening and comical--travelogue to the hidden battlefields of the Cold War, Tom Vanderbilt travels the Interstate (itself a product of the Cold War) to uncover the sites of Cold War architecture and reflect on their lasting heritage. In the process, Vanderbilt shows us what the Cold War landscape looked like, how architecture tried to adapt to the threat of mass destruction, how cities coped with the knowledge that they were nuclear targets, and finally what remains of the Cold War theater today, both its visible and invisible legacies. Ultimately, Vanderbilt gives us a deep look into our cultural soul, the dreams and fears that drove us for the last half of the 20th century.</p><p>This is a crucial and dazzling book. Masterful, and for me at least, intoxicating. It reminds us of the absurd and sinister ways humans have attempted to ensure their survival, and, without ever oversimplifying, it manages to be a ridiculously entertaining read. Amid the ruins of a different era in postwar national defense, its stepchild of abject paranoia, Vanderbilt--the perfect guide--finds levity and humanity. Survival City recalls the buoyant spirit of Michael Paterniti&#39;s Driving Einstein&#39;s Brain and the exacting but soulful reading of misplaced architectural aspirations of D.J. Waldie&#39;s Holy Land. - Dave Eggers, Author, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering GeniusTom Vanderbilt is a writer based in Brooklyn, New York.

Topics covered include planning, equipment, clothing, food, trail techniques, skiing techniques, snow camping, winter shelters, route finding and winter hazards. It has become a classic outdoor instructional book and is one of the most well received skiing books ever published.</p><p>This book combines the talents of National Geographic photographer Phil Scofield and author Ron Watters. It is filled with lots of helpful advice and practical suggestions on how to make backcountry skiing and winter camping enjoyable. Many of the dramatic photographs which supplement the text where taken by Scofield when he accompanied Watters on a 10-day backcountry ski journey across the Gospel Hump Wilderness in central Idaho.I admit. I'm a bit odd. I really enjoy camping in winter. A number of years ago, I wanted to write a book about it, and, at the same time, somehow capture the beauty and simplicity of it all. In that regard, I was helped by Phil Schofield. Phil was at the time, and still is, a <i>National Geographic</i> photographer. <p>He was willing to spend long days photographing the backcountry in the winter and even accompanied me and eight others on a 10-day journey across Central Idaho's Gospel-Hump Wilderness during some of the worst conditions imaginable. </p><p>I have much to thank Phil for.

But can America retain its position as the world&#x2019;s dominant power, or has it already begun to decline?<br></b><br>Historians have debated the rise and fall of empires for centuries. To date, however, no one has studied the far rarer phenomenon of hyperpowers&#x2014;those few societies that amassed such extraordinary military and economic might that they essentially dominated the world.<br>Now, in this sweeping history of globally dominant empires, bestselling author Amy Chua explains how hyperpowers rise and why they fall. In a series of brilliantly focused chapters, Chua examines history&#x2019;s hyperpowers&#x2014;Persia, Rome, Tang China, the Mongols, the Dutch, the British, and the United States&#x2014;and reveals the reasons behind their success, as well as the roots of their ultimate demise.<br>Chua&#x2019;s unprecedented study reveals a fascinating historical pattern. For all their differences, she argues, every one of these world-dominant powers was, at least by the standards of its time, extraordinarily pluralistic and tolerant. Each one succeeded by harnessing the skills and energies of individuals from very different backgrounds, and by attracting and exploiting highly talented groups that were excluded in other societies. Thus Rome allowed Africans, Spaniards, and Gauls alike to rise to the highest echelons of power, while the &#x201c;barbarian&#x201d; Mongols conquered their vast domains only because they practiced an ethnic and religious tolerance unheard of in their time. In contrast, <br><br>Nazi Germany and imperial Japan, while wielding great power, failed to attain global dominance as a direct result of their racial and religious intolerance.<br>But Chua also uncovers a great historical irony: in virtually every instance, multicultural tolerance eventually sowed the seeds of decline, and diversity became a liability, triggering conflict, hatred, and violence.<br>The United States is the quintessential example of a power that rose to global dominance through tolerance and diversity. The secret to America&#x2019;s success has always been its unsurpassed ability to attract enterprising&nbsp;immigrants. Today, however, concerns about outsourcing and uncontrolled illegal immigration are producing a backlash against our tradition of cultural openness. Has America finally reached a &#x201c;tipping point&#x201d;? Have we gone too far in the direction of diversity and tolerance to maintain cohesion and unity? Will we be overtaken by rising powers like China, the EU or even India?<br>Chua shows why American power may have already exceeded its limits and why it may be in our interest to retreat from our go-it-alone approach and promote a new multilateralism in both domestic and foreign affairs.</p></p><p><p>AMY CHUA is the John Duff Jr. Professor of Law at Yale Law School.

More significant, the world knew its antiquity. Its scholars had compiled long dynastic lists, and simple addition appeared to prove that kings whose monuments were still visible had ruled more than four millenniums before.<br>&#x2014;A. T. Olmstead, <i>History of the Persian Empire</i>, 1948<br>I should be glad, Onesicritus, to come back to life for a little while after my death to discover how men read these present events then.<br>&#x2014;Alexander the Great, quoted by Lucien in &#x201c;<i>How to Write History</i>,&#x201d; circa AD 40<br>The word <i>paradise</i> is Persian in origin. Old Persian had a term <i>pairidaeza</i>, which the Greeks rendered as <i>paradeisos</i>, referring to the fabulous royal parks and pleasure gardens of the Achaemenids&#x2014;the kings of the mighty Persian Empire who ruled from roughly 559 to 330 BC. Indeed, the earliest Greek translators of the Old Testament used this term for the Garden of Eden and the afterlife, as if to suggest that the Achaemenid paradises were as close as man had come to replicating heaven on earth. (1)<br><br>The Achaemenid paradises were famous throughout the ancient world. Their riches, it was said, included every tree bearing every fruit known to man, the most fragrant and dazzling flowers that grew anywhere from Libya to India, and exotic animals from the farthest reaches of an empire covering more than two million square miles. There were Parthian camels, Assyrian rams, Armenian horses, Cappadocian mules, Nubian giraffes, Indian elephants, Lydian ibex, Babylonian buffalo, and the most ferocious lions, bulls, and wild beasts from throughout the kingdom. Not just formal gardens, the paradises were also centers for horticultural experimentation, zoological parks, and hunting reserves. A royal hunt in a single paradise could yield four thousand head. (2)<br><br>In this respect, the Achaemenid paradises were a living metaphor for the Achaemenid Empire as a whole. Founded around 559 BC by Cyrus the Great and spanning more than two centuries, the Achaemenid Persian Empire was, even by today's standards, one of the most culturally diverse and religiously open empires in history. The Achaemenid kings actively recruited the most talented artisans, craftsmen, laborers, and warriors from throughout the empire. In 500 BC, Persepolis was home to Greek doctors, Elamite scribes, Lydian woodworkers, Ionian stonecutters, and Sardian smiths. Similarly, the Achaemenid military drew its colossal strength from Median commanders, Phoenician sailors, Libyan charioteers, Cissian cavalrymen, and hundreds of thousands of foot soldiers from Ethiopia, Bactria, Sogdiana, and elsewhere in the empire. (3)<br><br>For most Westerners, antiquity refers solely to classical Greece and Rome. But the Achaemenid Empire was the first hyperpower in world history, governing a territory larger than all the ancient empires, including even Rome's. Achaemenid Persia dwarfed&#x2014;in fact conquered and annexed&#x2014;the great kingdoms of Assyria, Babylonia, and Egypt, ruling at its peak as many as 42 million people, nearly a third of the world&#x2019;s total population. (4) How could a relatively small number of Persians govern so vast a territory and population? This chapter will suggest that tolerance was critical: first in allowing the Persians to establish their world&#x2013;dominant empire, then in helping them maintain it.<br>WHERE IS BACTRIA, AND SHOULD WE BELIEVE HERODOTUS?<br><br>As early as 5000 BC, the great plateau that is now modern Iran was already populated. Its early inhabitants had some curious family practices:<br>[A]mong the Derbices, men older than seventy were killed and eaten by their kinsfolk, and old women were strangled and buried...Among the Caspians, who gave their name to the sea formerly called Hyrcanian, those over seventy were starved. Corpses were exposed in a desert place and observed. If carried from the bier by vultures, the dead were considered most fortunate, less so if taken by wild beasts or dogs; but it was the height of misfortune if the bodies remained untouched. ...[F]arther east, equally disgusting practices continued until Alexander's invasion. The sick and aged were thrown while still alive to waiting dogs. (5)<br>Starting in the second millennium BC, these friendly peoples succumbed to the Aryan conquest. The term &#x201c;Aryan,&#x201d; despite the Nazis&#x2019; later twisting, is essentially a linguistic designation referring to a variety of peoples who spoke eastern Indo&#x2013;European languages or dialects and migrated from southern Russia and central Asia into India, Mesopotamia, and the Iranian plateau. How the Aryans overpowered the preexisting societies is unclear, but within a few hundred years they had established kingdoms in eponymous territories throughout the region: for example, the Medes in Media, the Bactrians in Bactria, and the Persians in Persis or Parsa. (6)<br><br>The Persians themselves consisted of a number of tribes and clans, of which the Achaemenids were one. In time, the Achaemenids would extend Persian rule to the other Aryan kingdoms. Indeed the name Iran derives from the Persian word <i>Eransahr</i>, meaning &#x201c;Empire of the Aryans.&#x201d; The Achaemenid Empire was, however, far larger than modern&#x2013;day Iran. Its provinces or satrapies, with their archaic names, correspond to some modern headline-making regions in the Middle East and central Asia. Babylon, for example, which the Achaemenids conquered in 539 BC, stood in what is now Iraq, approximately sixty miles from Baghdad. Sogdiana was located in modern Uzbekistan. And Bactria, so significant in the Achaemenid Empire, maps roughly onto present-day Afghanistan. (7)<br><br>A note about sources: The Achaemenid rulers left virtually no written histories of their own empire. The ancient Persians transmitted the triumphs and deeds of their kings primarily through oral traditions. The few written records we have from the Achaemenid kings consist principally of royal inscriptions&#x2014;for example, Cyrus&#x2019;s cylinder or Darius&#x2019;s trilingual engravings on the cliffs of Behistun. Unfortunately, these inscriptions are not narrative accounts of actual events. Rather, they are abstract exaltations of royal power and virtue and more than a little propagandistic. Cyrus&#x2019;s cylinder, for example, proclaims, &#x201c;I am Cyrus, king of the universe, great king, mighty king, king of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the world quarters.&#x201d; (8)<br><br>As a result, most of what we know about the Achaemenid Empire comes from a very limited number of Greek sources, including Xenophon&#x2019;s <i>Anabasis</i>, Aeschylus's <i>Persians</i>, and, most important, Herodotus&#x2019;s <i>Histories</i>. Most of these classical authors lived in the latter half of the Achaemenid period and presumably based their accounts in part on oral testimonies and Persian legends passed on over the years; here again, it may be difficult to separate historical fact from political propaganda.<br><br>Additionally, depending on the era, the Greeks were the enemies, subjects, or conquerors of the Persians. Thus, Greek authors were not necessarily the most impartial expositors of Persian history&#x2014;imagine Saddam Hussein writing <i>A History of the United States</i>, 1990-2006. As a result, Greek references to Persians as &#x201c;barbarians of Asia,&#x201d; or the frequent Greek portrayals of the Achaemenid kings as decadent and gluttonous, should be taken with a grain of salt. An exceptional case may be Herodotus, who wrote about the Persians with such little hostility, relative to that of his contemporaries, that Plutarch accused him of being a &#x201c;friend of the barbarians&#x201d; (<i>philobarbaros</i>).9<br><br>In general, there are enough corroborating sources from different perspectives, often supported by archaeological evidence, to feel comfortable with most of the basic facts about the Achaemenid Empire. Where there are doubts, discrepancies, or differing interpretations among historians, I will point them out.<br><b>TOLERANCE AND THE RISE OF THE ACHAEMENID EMPIRE</b><br><br>The story of the Achaemenid Empire begins with Cyrus the Great. Cyrus&#x2019;s origins are shrouded in legend. According to the version favored by Herodotus, Cyrus was the grandson of Astyages, the weak final ruler of the powerful kingdom of Media. When Cyrus was born&#x2014;to Astyages&#x2019;s daughter and her husband, Cambyses, a Persian from the Achaemenid clan&#x2014;Astyages ordered his newborn grandson killed, after an ominous dream suggesting that Cyrus would one day depose him.<br><br>The plan failed, as these types of plans always do. Harpagos, whom Astyages had ordered to kill Cyrus, gave the baby instead to a shepherd, who raised Cyrus as his own. Astyages eventually discovered that Harpagos had deceived him and that Cyrus was alive, but his magi advisors reinterpreted his dream so that Astyages feared Cyrus no longer. Cyrus was sent to Persia, where he rejoined his Achaemenid family. Harpagos, however, did not fare as well: Astyages invited him to a banquet, where he served him the flesh of his own son mixed with lamb. (10)<br><br>A different version of the Cyrus legend has him abandoned by the shepherd but saved and suckled in the wild by a female dog. Yet another says that his mother was a goatherd and his father a Persian bandit. However he got there, Cyrus had by 559 BC become a vassal king under Astyages in Persia. A few years later, Cyrus led a rebellion against Astyages. Assisting him were a number of Persian tribes and clans, most prominently the Achaemenids, as well as the same Harpagos who had been served the unappetizing dinner.<br><br>In 550 BC, Cyrus defeated Astyages and took over the Median kingdom and its claims to Assyria, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia, and Cappadocia. By 539, Cyrus had conquered both the Lydian kingdom (located in modern&#x2013;day Turkey) and the formidable neo&#x2013;Babylonian kingdom. He was now ruler of the largest empire that had ever existed. (11)<br><br>The strategy Cyrus employed was essentially &#x201c;decapitation&#x201d;&#x2014;but of leadership, not of the leader&#x2019;s head. After conquering each new kingdom, Cyrus simply removed the local ruler, typically sparing his life and allowing him to live in luxury, and replaced him with a satrap who governed the territory, or satrapy. The satrap was almost always a member of the Persian aristocracy. Beneath the satrap, however, Cyrus interfered very little with the daily lives of his subject peoples, leaving them their gods and their disparate cultures. He embraced linguistic diversity, including as languages used for official administrative purposes in the empire Aramaic, Elamite, Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, Lydian, and Lycian. He codified and enforced local laws, keeping in place local authority structures. It was not unusual for high&#x2013;ranking officials in conquered territories to retain their official positions under Achaemenid rule. Babylonian records also show that the same families often dominated business before and after Cyrus's conquest. (12)<br><br>Perhaps most striking was Cyrus&#x2019;s religious tolerance&#x2014;his legendary willingness to honor the temples, cults, and local gods of the peoples he conquered. In a sense, it was easier in the ancient world for rulers to allow the worship of multiple deities. Unlike Judaism or Christianity, the religions of the ancient Near East were syncretic. They assumed the existence of many gods, each guarding its own city, people, or aspects of life. But this syncretic worldview did not necessarily imply that one people had to respect or tolerate the religious beliefs of others. On the contrary, many conquering kings of antiquity liked to demonstrate the superiority of their own gods&#x2014;and assert their own power&#x2014;precisely by suppressing and destroying rival cults.<br><br>For example, not long before the fall of the Assyrian Empire, the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal conquered the country of Elam. He ravaged the entire kingdom, leveling major cities, desecrating temples, and dragging off sacred cult objects. He also ordered his troops to destroy the royal tombs of the Elamite kings because they, in Ashurbanipal&#x2019;s own words, &#x201c;had not revered the deities Ashur and Ishtar,&#x201d; his &#x201c;lords.&#x201d; Assyrian kings similarly razed the cities of Jerusalem and Thebes and left many other districts a wilderness stripped of human and animal population. (13)<br><br>Nabunidus, the king of Babylonia when it fell to Cyrus, is also famous for his religious intolerance. He suppressed popular worship of the god Marduk, forcing adherence instead to the deity of his own cult, the moon-god Sin. If we can believe the inscriptions on the Cyrus cylinder, now in the British Museum, Nabunidus &#x201c;did evil&#x201d; to his subjects, tormenting them by imposing &#x201c;a cult that was not proper to them.&#x201d; By contrast, Cyrus took just the opposite approach.<br><br>Entering the city of Babylon with his army, Cyrus prostrated himself before the god Marduk in order to win over the local people. He presented himself as the liberator of the Babylonians, divinely chosen and assisted by their own great deity. In his own words from the Cyrus cylinder:<br>When I made my gracious entry into Babylon, with rejoicing and pleasure I took up my lordly residence in the royal palace. Marduk, the great lord, turned the noble race of the Babylonians toward me, and I gave daily care to his worship.<br><br>I did not allow anybody to terrorize [any place] of the [country of Sumer] and Akkad. I strove for peace in Babylon and in all his [other] sacred cities. As to the inhabitants of Babylon...I abolished forced labour...From Nineveh, Assur and Susa, Akkad, Eshnunna, Zamban, Me&#x2013;Turnu and Der until the region of Gutium, I returned to these sacred cities on the other side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a long time. (14)<br>Although this account is in part self&#x2013;glorifying propaganda, it is nonetheless instructive of how Cyrus wished to be perceived by his subjects.<br><br>Classical sources consistently attest to Cyrus&#x2019;s tolerance and magnanimity. In his romanticized <i>Cyropaedia</i>, for example, Xenophon writes:<br>Believing this man [Cyrus] to be deserving of all admiration, we have therefore investigated who he was in his origin, what natural endowments he possessed, and what sort of education he had enjoyed, that he so greatly excelled in governing...That Cyrus&#x2019;s empire was the greatest and most glorious of all the kingdoms in Asia&#x2014;of that it may bear its own witness...And although it was of such magnitude, it was governed by the single will of Cyrus; and he honoured his subjects and cared for them as if they were his own children; and they, on their part, revered Cyrus as a father. (15)<br>As a side note, Xenophon also writes admiringly of Cyrus&#x2019;s skill in cultivating public image. At a parade in Persepolis, Cyrus &#x201c;appeared so great and so goodly to look upon,&#x201d; evidently in part because he chose to wear the physique&#x2013;flattering Median native costume:<br>[Cyrus] thought that if anyone had any personal defect [the Median] dress would help to conceal it, and that it made the wearer look very tall and very handsome. For they have shoes of such a form that without being detected the wearer can easily put something into the soles so as to make him look taller than he is. He encouraged also the fashion of pencilling the eyes, that they might seem more lustrous than they are, and of using cosmetics to make the complexion look better than their nature made it. He trained his associates also not to spit or wipe the nose in public. (16)<br>The biblical accounts of Cyrus are even more exalting. After conquering Babylon, Cyrus freed the Jews from their Babylonian captivity and allowed them to return to Jerusalem. For this benevolence, Jewish prophets hailed him as a savior. The biblical book of Isaiah describes Cyrus as &#x201c;anointed&#x201d; by Yahweh, the Jewish name for God:<br>Thus says Yahweh to his anointed, to C...</p><h2>Short Prayers for the Long Day</h2><p>Divided into Morning, Noon, and Night, these prayers, reflections, and meditations have been loved and used throughout the centuries in a variety of religious traditions.</p><p></p><h2>St Francis of Assisi: Writings for a Gospel Life (Crossroad Spiritual Legacy Series)</h2><p>This popular presentation of the spirituality and essential writings of Saint Francis of Assisi, one of the most revered of the spiritual masters, is part of the Crossroads Spiritual Legacy Series.</p><p></p><h2>The Age of Miracles: A Novel</h2><p><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY<br><i>People &#x2219; O: The Oprah Magazine &#x2219; Financial Times &#x2219; Kansas City Star &#x2219; BookPage &#x2219; Kirkus Reviews &#x2219; Publishers Weekly &#x2219; Booklist</i></b><br><br>With a voice as distinctive and original as that of <i>The Lovely Bones,</i> and for the fans of the speculative fiction of Margaret Atwood, Karen Thompson Walker&#x2019;s <i>The Age of Miracles</i> is a luminous, haunting, and unforgettable debut novel about coming of age set against the backdrop of an utterly altered world.<br><br><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER</b><br><br><i>&#x201c;It still amazes me how little we really knew. . . .

And it turns out the whimper can be a lot harder to cope with. The Earth's rotation slows, gradually stretching out days and nights and subtly affecting the planet's gravity. The looming apocalypse parallels the adolescent struggles of 10-year-old Julia, as her comfortable suburban life succumbs to a sort of domestic deterioration. Julia confronts her parents' faltering marriage, illness, the death of a loved one, her first love, and her first heartbreak. Karen Thompson Walker is a gifted storyteller. Her language is precise and poetic, but style never overpowers the realism she imbues to her characters and the slowing Earth they inhabit. Most impressively, Thompson Walker has written a coming-of-age tale that asks whether it's worth coming of age at all in a world that might end at any minute. Like the best stories about the end of the world, <em>The Age of Miracles</em> is about the existence of hope and whether it can prevail in the face of uncertainty. --<em>Kevin Nguyen</em></p> <p><b>Q&amp;A with Karen Thompson Walker</b></p> <p><strong>Q.

It was the only way I could imagine writing the book. Adolescence is an extraordinary time of life, a period when the simple passage of time results in dramatic consequences, when we grow and change at seemingly impossible speeds. It seemed natural to tell the story of the slowing, which is partly about time, in the context of middle school. It was also a way of concentrating on the fine-grain details of everyday life, which was very important to me. I was interested in exploring the ways in which life carries on, even in the face of profound uncertainty.</p> <p>Julia felt like a natural narrator for this story because she listens more than she speaks, and she watches more than she acts. I think the fact that Julia is an only child is part of why she's so observant. Julia also places a very high value on her friendships, and is unusually attuned to the subtle tensions in her parents' marriage, which increase as the slowing unfolds.</p> <p><strong>Q. The details of how such a slowing would affect us and our environment are rendered quite realistically. How did you get these details right? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>No one knows exactly what would happen if the rotation of the earth slowed the way it does in my book, so I had some freedom. I did some research at the outset, but I came across many of my favorite details accidentally. Whenever I read an article that contained a potentially relevant detail--anything from sleep disorders, to new technologies for growing plants in greenhouses, to the various ways people and governments reacted to the financial crisis--I would knit it into the fabric of the book. After I finished the book, I had an astrophysicist read it for scientific accuracy, which was an extremely nerve-racking experience. I was relieved by how many of my details he found plausible, but made some adjustments based on what he said.</p> <p>In general, I wanted my book to seem as real as possible. I recently read a <em>Guardian</em> interview with the Portuguese writer Jos� Saramago, who said that his books were about "the possibility of the impossible." He explained that even if the premise of a book seemed "impossible," it was important to him that the development of that premise be logical and rational. That's exactly the way I wanted <em>The Age of Miracles</em> to function.</p> <p><strong>Q. Like Julia, you grew up in Southern California, where natural disasters are always looming. Do you think this influenced you in writing of <em>The Age of Miracles</em>?</strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>I grew up in San Diego on a cul-de-sac of tract houses much like the one where <em>The Age of Miracles</em> takes place. In most ways, California was a very pleasant place to grow up. But it could also be a little scary. I remember how the sky would sometimes fill with smoke during fire season, how the smoke hung in the air for days at a time, burning our throats and turning everything slightly orange. I remember the way the windows rattled at the start of every earthquake, and the way the chandelier above our dinner table would swing back and forth until the shaking stopped. I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, worried that an earthquake or a fire would strike at night. But when I think of those years now, I realize that my novel grew partly out of my lifelong habit of imagining disaster.</p> <p>If I've given the impression that I was constantly afraid as a child, that's not right. In fact, one of the things I remember most vividly about living in California is the way we mostly ignored the possibility of danger. We always knew that the "big one"--the giant earthquake that scientists believe will one day hit the region--could strike at any time, but mostly we lived as if it never would. Life often felt idyllic: We played soccer, we went swimming, we went walking on the beach. A little bit of denial is part of what it means to live in California. Then again, maybe that's also just part of being alive. I really wanted to capture that feeling in <em>The Age of Miracles.</em></p><p><b>Karen Thompson Walker</b> is the author of<i> The Age of Miracles</i>, which was a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.

Cooke engages with the data and the philosophy behind this movement, applauding conservatarianism as a force that can help Republicans mend the many ills that have plagued their party in recent years. Conservatarians are vexed by Republicans&#x2019; failure to cut the size and scope of Washington D.C., but they are critical of some libertarians for their unacceptable positions on abortion, national defense, and immigration. They applaud conservatives&#x2019; efforts to protect Second Amendment rights&#x2014;efforts that have recently been wildly successful&#x2014;but they see the War on Drugs as an unmitigated disaster that goes against everything conservatives ought to value. <br> &nbsp;<br> All movements run the risk of stagnation, and of losing touch with the principles and values that made them successful in the first place. In this book<i>, </i>Charles Cooke shows the way back to a better and more honest conservatism that champions limited government, reality-based policy, and favor for the smallest minority of all: the individual.</p><p><b>CHARLES C.W. COOKE</b> is a writer at&nbsp;<i>National Review</i> and a graduate of the University of Oxford, at which he studied modern history and politics. His work has focused especially on Anglo-American history, British liberty, free speech, the Second Amendment, and American exceptionalism. Charles is the cohost of the <i>Mad Dogs and Englishmen</i> podcast, and has broadcast for HBO (<i>Real Time with Bill Maher</i>), BBC, MSNBC, Fox News, <i>The Blaze</i>, CNBC, CTV, ABC, <i>Sun News</i>, and CBS. In addition to <i>National Review</i>, his writing has also been published by the <i>New York Times,&nbsp;National Interest</i>, the <i>Washington Times</i>, and the <i>New York Post</i>."Well-written and vital." <br><b>-Tyler Cowen, bestselling author of <i>The Great Stagnation</i></b><br><br>"Superbly well written and argued and deeply insightful. I found it particularly so on what I take to be the overarching policy implication of Cooke&#x2019;s argument: the need for localism and decentralization to serve as core principles of the Right&#x2019;s approach to the role of government and its case for limits on that role. This is a timeless truth that is nonetheless especially timely in 21st-century America." <br><b>-Yuval Levin, <i>National Review</i></b><br><br>"First-rate...A&nbsp;summons to conservatives to unite around the &#x201c;timeless principles&#x201d; that inform the American founding. In applying those principles to a host of prominent issues of public policy, [Cooke] demonstrates refreshing common sense, a confident command of empirical realities, and savvy political judgment." <br><b>-Peter Berkowitz, <i>Real Clear Politics<br><br></i></b>"Quite good...Can conservatives appeal to the folks who are tired of the shrillest voices telling them what to watch and how to live their lives? Probably not,&nbsp;if folks like Mike Huckabee&nbsp;have their way. But if the future belongs to the Charles C.W. Cookes of the world? Well, then maybe we have a shot." <br><b>-Sonny Bunch, <i>Washington Free Beacon<br><br></i></b>"Essential reading...Artfully weaving hard data (without descending into pedantic statistical lists) with relevant history, Cooke produces several compelling arguments covering an array of topic. Unlike books that dabble in theory but provide no realistically applicable suggestions,&nbsp;<i>The Conservatarian Manifesto</i>&nbsp;goes beyond thoughtful ponderance and illuminates a pathway forward."<br> <b><i>-Legal Insurrection</i></b><br><br>"For the growing number of us who have been straddling both conservatism and libertarianism -- with neither one offering a complete prescription for the right-leaning worldview -- Conservatarianism has arrived. Here, it is examined and argued brilliantly by the ever-astute and witty Charles C. W. Cooke. Prepare to hear The Conservatarian Manifesto cited quite a bit as we head towards 2016."<br> <b>&#x2013;S.E.

In this lively and provocative debut, Charles C. W. Cooke offers an unflinching, polemic-free diagnosis of the issues on which conservatives and libertarians agree (limited government, gun rights) and&#x2014;more importantly&#x2014;disagree (the drug wars, foreign policy, and immigration). &nbsp;Whether you lean conservative or libertarian, Cooke&#x2019;s clear-eyed manifesto is an important read for anyone who wants to preserve and future-proof the Founders&#x2019; vision.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2013;David Burge, Iowahawk blogger</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Charles C.

He embarked on his career in the mid-1940s, when modern photojournalism was beginning to expand in Sweden. His breakthrough photo-essays were published both in Sweden and abroad, for magazines such as <i>Life</i>, <i>Picture Post</i> and <i>Illustrated</i>. In the mid-1950s Nilsson started experimenting with new photographic techniques, using microscopes to 'get closer'. His revealing macro studies of the human body's inner mysteries were a big sensation and were published in magazines and books worldwide. In 1965 his groundbreaking images illustrating the beginning of life, from conception to birth, were published in the book, <b>A Child is Born</b>, which has since been translated into twenty languages. He has also made several award-winning films. Lennart Nilsson was designated an Honorary Doctor of Medicine by the Karolinska Institute in 1976 and he is Honorary Doctor of Philosophy of the Technische Unversitat Braunschweig in Germany (2002) as well as of Linkoping University in Sweden (2003).</p><h2>Churchill and the admirals</h2><p>Winston Churchill enjoyed two stints as First Lord of the Admiralty, at the start of the First World War and at the start of the Second. He retained close interest in naval matters, especially as the defeat of the U-boat menace was so vital in both wars to maintain the vital supplies so necessary for Britain&#x2019;s war efforts.

She lives in New York.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;When elephants Ann and Bess play school, Ann makes it quite clear that younger Min is not welcome. "'This is a school zone Min....Here is the line,' said Ann. ' You may not step over it.'" Clever Min is not deterred. She promptly begins gathering materials&#x2014;board, rocks, a big tube, a rope, and a helmet. Before long, Min has engineered a rocket with a seesaw delivery system (Wile E. Coyote-style) that, much to Ann's dismay, takes her right into the school zone. "'Hi!' said Min. "I didn't step over the line. I flew over it.'" The text uses contractions, simple words, and also some challenging terms such as "scientist." The pen and ink with watercolor illustrations clearly depict the action and follow the text. They provide just the right amount of detail, expression, and white space to help new readers along.

The Bible identifies this personality as the Antichrist. But now things were making sense to Thomas &#x2013; world affairs, changes to U.S. domestic and foreign policy, a renewed focus on the Middle East, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Babylon &#x2013; and he found it astonishing. The words, deeds, gestures and coded language of the world&#x2019;s most powerful men were clearly pointing to an ancient, prophetic, cryptic and even terrifying reality. What even the best researchers of the Illuminati and veiled fraternities such as the Freemasons were never able to fully decipher is spelled out herein for the first time. The power at work behind global affairs and why current planetary powers are hurriedly aligning for a New Order from Chaos is exposed. Perhaps most incredibly, one learns how ancient prophets actually foresaw and forewarned of this time. Thomas believes this New World Order is very near.</p><p>Thomas Horn is CEO of Raiders News Network, a syndicated columnist, and the bestselling author of Nephilim Stargates.

In this lavishly illustrated book, Silverman describes how he paints haunting portraits and figures in oil, watercolor, and pastel and shows how he handles each medium in a series of step-by-step demonstrations with nearly every step reproduced in full color. <br><br>The author begins with a brief, fascinating account of his struggle to achieve a personal style and make his mark as a realist painter...at a time when the galleries and the art press were dominated by abstract painting. He then describes his studio setup, materials, and methods for painting in oil, watercolor, and pastel. He explains how he develops is pictorial ideas; tells how he often paints a series of interrelated pictures to explore a theme; and is refreshingly frank in his self-criticism, his successes and his failures. <br><br>In seven step-by-step demonstrations, with each shown in full-page size, the reader has closeups of the artist painting studies of figures on a beach and a self-portrait in oil; two figures studies and a family portrait in pastel; and a portrait and a figure in an architectural setting in watercolor.</p><p></p><h2>Weapons and Fighting Techiniques of the Medieval Warrior: 1000-1500 AD</h2><p><p><i>Weapons and Fighting Techniques of the Medieval warrior </i> offers an highly-illustrated fact-filled introduction to the weaponry and fighting methods of the Middles Ages. Divided into four chapters, the main types of Medieval warrior are covered separately: mounted knights, foot soldiers, missile troops and siege engineers and sappers.</p><p>The popular image of the mounted knight dominating the battlefields of Medieval warfare was far more compelled. Although rarely celebrated in Medieval art or literature, the weapons, technology, and techniques of the ordinary foot soldiers, such as the longbow men and pike-armed landsknechts, had a revolutionary impact on the development of warfare in the middle ages. Disciplined groups of archers were able to defeat better-armored and numerically superior forces of noble knights at battles such as Crecy (1346) and Agincourt (1415), while the development of tightly packed formations of pikemen came to definite military encounters from the early fifteenth century. More significantly, the introduction of gunpowder weapons in the mid fifteenth century had a fundamentally democratizing effect on the way battles were fought and ended the power of heavily-armored cavalry. Written in an accessible style for the non-expert, the book shows how the development of new weapons technology and techniques came to change the face of European warfare from 1,000 to 1,500 AD.</p></p><p><p><b>Martin J.

Stewart Tolnay and E. M. Beck empirically test competing explanations of the causes of lynching, using U.S. Census and historical voting data and a newly constructed inventory of southern lynch victims. Among their surprising findings: lynching responded to fluctuations in the price of cotton, decreasing in frequency when prices rose and increasing when they fell.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Stewart E.

A dry, hot Northern California school vacation stretches before Rachel and her younger sister, Patty&#x2014;the daughters of a larger-than-life, irresistibly handsome (and chronically unfaithful) detective father and the mother whose heart he broke.</p><p>When we first meet her, Patty is eleven&#x2014;a gangly kid who loves basketball and dogs and would do anything for her older sister, Rachel. Rachel is obsessed with making up stories and believes she possesses the gift of knowing what's in the minds of people around her. She has visions, whether she wants to or not. Left to their own devices, the sisters spend their days studying record jackets, concocting elaborate fantasies about the mysterious neighbor who moved in down the street, and playing dangerous games on the mountain that looms behind their house.</p><p>When young women start turning up dead on the mountain, the girls' father is put in charge of finding the murderer known as the "Sunset Strangler." Watching her father's life slowly unravel as months pass and more women are killed, Rachel embarks on her most dangerous game yet . . . using herself as bait to catch the killer. But rather than cracking the case, the consequences of Rachel's actions will destroy her father's career and alter forever the lives of everyone she loves.</p><p>Thirty years later, still haunted by the belief that the killer remains at large, Rachel constructs a new strategy to smoke out the Sunset Strangler and vindicate her father&#x2014;a plan that unexpectedly unearths a long-buried family secret.</p><p>Loosely inspired by the Trailside Killer case that terrorized Marin County, California, in the late 1970s, <em>After Her</em> is part thriller, part love story.

DCI Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard, the lead detective, is immediately given two urgent orders by his supervisor at the Yard: solve the murders quickly and keep his wife, the Honourable Daisy Dalrymple Fletcher, away from the case! Thankfully, Daisy&#x2019;s off visiting their daughter at school. But when a teacher is found dead, Daisy is once again in the thick of it. As Daisy tries to solve one murder, Alec discovers that the three victims in his case were in the same Army company during World War I, that their murders are likely related to specific events that unfolded during that tragic conflict, and that, unless the killer is revealed and stopped, those three might only be the beginning.</p><p>CAROL A DUNN is the author of the Daisy Dalrymple series as well as other mysteries and historical novels. Born and raised in England, she lives in Eugene, Oregon.ONE<br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Ring a&nbsp;</i>ring o&#x2019; roses,&#x201d; sang Daisy for the fifth time. &#x201c;A pocket full of posies. Atishoo, atishoo, we all fall down.&#x201d; She subsided thankfully into the rocking chair while Oliver and Miranda flung themselves on the floor and rolled around squealing. Actually, Oliver had anticipated the d�nouement as usual and dropped at the first &#x201c;atishoo.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Now that&#x2019;s enough of that, twins,&#x201d; said Nurse severely. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid we&#x2019;re getting a little overexcited, Mummy. It&#x2019;ll end in tears, you mark my words.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Now that they&#x2019;re so active, they need the exercise, and it&#x2019;s rained too hard to go out in the garden for days.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not proper June weather at all!&#x201d; She sounded as if it was Daisy&#x2019;s fault.<br>Nana, who was even more apt to get overexcited than the toddlers and had had to be tied to a table-leg, whined mournfully.<br>&#x201c;Nana play,&#x201d; Miranda commanded, going over to the little dog and hugging her. Nana frantically licked her face.<br>&#x201c;Now come away at once, Miss Miranda! You&#x2019;ll get germs.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nonsense,&#x201d; said Daisy. &#x201c;I was kissed by dogs every day of my childhood and here I am, healthy as a horse.&#x201d; She looked round as the door opened. &#x201c;What is it, Elsie?&#x201d;<br>The parlourmaid bobbed a sketchy curtsy. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Sergeant Tring on the telephone, madam. The master would like a word with you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you. I&#x2019;ll come down. I&#x2019;ll be back in a minute, babies.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mama go,&#x201d; Miranda observed dispassionately.<br>&#x201c;Mama!&#x201d; her brother shrieked.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back, Oliver. I&#x2019;ve got to go and talk to Daddy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dada!&#x201d; Oliver rushed after her and had to be detached from her leg by Bertha, the nurserymaid.<br>Hastily closing the door, Daisy heard Nurse Gilpin mutter, &#x201c;I knew it. It never does to spoil them.&#x201d;<br>She hurried downstairs, filled with foreboding. When Alec rang up in the middle of the day, it invariably meant a disruption of their plans. Not that plans were ever anything but tentative when one&#x2019;s husband was a detective chief inspector at Scotland Yard, liable to be called to the outer reaches of the kingdom at a moment&#x2019;s notice.<br>She picked up the &#x201c;daffodil&#x201d; stand, sat down on the chair by the hall table, and put the receiver to her ear. &#x201c;Tom?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Afternoon, Mrs. Fletcher. How&#x2019;s my godson?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Screaming for Dada. Healthy lungs! But I assume he won&#x2019;t be seeing him for a while?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The chief&#x2019;ll have to tell you about that. Can you hold on half a mo, please, he&#x2019;s on another telephone.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course. How is Mrs. Tring?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Blooming.&#x201d; DS Tring adored his wife, a large woman though not as large as Tom. That didn&#x2019;t stop his having a wonderful way with female servants when he needed to extract information. &#x201c;And Miss Miranda?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Likewise. Her vocabulary grows by leaps and bounds. Not quite up to yours yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to look to my laurels.&#x201d;<br>Daisy pictured his luxuriant moustache twitching as he grinned. &#x201c;Belinda&#x2019;s pretty good, too. It&#x2019;s her school sports day on Saturday. Oh no, don&#x2019;t tell me&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no way of knowing, Mrs. Fletcher. Here&#x2019;s the chief.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Alec? Darling, you&#x2019;re not going to miss Bel&#x2019;s sports day, are you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I hope not. If we haven&#x2019;t made an arrest by then, I might be able to sneak away for the afternoon. Epping can&#x2019;t be more than forty miles from Saffron Walden.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re only going to Epping? I was afraid it might be Northumberland.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You always are, love. I can&#x2019;t think why.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s so far away. But Epping&#x2014;You&#x2019;ll come home for the night, then?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, but don&#x2019;t wait dinner for me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t half the murderers in London bury bodies in Epping Forest?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s often been considered a convenient spot.&#x201d; Alec sounded amused.<br>&#x201c;If that&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;re going, don&#x2019;t forget to take Wellington boots. It&#x2019;s still belting down.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The forecast&#x2019;s for a clearing trend tonight. Let&#x2019;s hope they&#x2019;re right for once.&#x201d;<br>Daisy jumped to the obvious conclusion. &#x201c;So you&nbsp;<i>are</i>&nbsp;going to dig up a body in Epping Forest?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Three of them. For a start. I&#x2019;m only telling you because there&#x2019;s no conceivable way you can get yourself mixed up in this case.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course not! But do be careful, darling. I&#x2019;d hate for the fourth body to be you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No fear of that, love. I must run.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Should I tell Mrs. Dobson to leave something out for you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ll pick up a bite to eat somewhere. Coming, Tom!&#x201d; He said good-bye and rang off.<br>Daisy hung up. Three bodies! Assuming they had all been killed by the same person&#x2014;a madman? Or perhaps a member of an East End gang? There would be a lot of pressure on the police to arrest someone before another murder followed. Not that Alec didn&#x2019;t always clear up his cases as quickly as possible.<br>Still, today was Wednesday. It didn&#x2019;t seem likely that he would be finished by Saturday, or even free to take an afternoon off. Poor Belinda! Though happy at school, she was so looking forward to seeing them. She would have to make do with her stepmother. Luckily she was used to Daddy disappearing at unpredictable intervals. She had been a detective&#x2019;s daughter much longer than Daisy had been a detective&#x2019;s wife. The twins had yet to learn.<br>But if Daisy had married a man considered suitable by her mother, the Dowager Lady Dalrymple, no doubt he would have gone off huntin&#x2019;, shootin&#x2019;, and fishin&#x2019; all over the country, and spent much of the rest of his time stridin&#x2019; across his acres taking potshots at rabbits and pigeons.<br>She went back to the nursery. The twins rushed to her, jabbering. They really needed more exercise, but a glance at the window showed no sign of the promised clearing. A nice noisy game would do. One look at Nurse Gilpin&#x2019;s face told her that was a battle she didn&#x2019;t want to fight.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll play something quieter now. Bertha, would you untie Nana, please?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes&#x2019;m.&#x201d; The nurserymaid went to help Miranda, who got there first.<br>Daisy sat cross-legged on the floor, to Mrs. Gilpin&#x2019;s manifest disapproval&#x2014;but then, she disapproved of practically everything Daisy did in her nursery. &#x201c;Oliver, come and sit with Mummy.&#x201d;<br>Oliver promptly scrambled up into the rocking chair and sat there looking pleased with himself, babbling nonsense syllables. But when both Miranda and Nana sat neatly and expectantly on the floor in front of Daisy, he clambered down and joined them.<br>&#x201c;Clap handies all together,&#x201d; warbled Daisy, suiting action to the words. &#x201c;Clap hands away. This is the way we exercise upon a rainy day.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Escaping central London just before the start of the rush-hour, the police car crossed the industrial wasteland of the Lea Valley, bleaker than ever in still-pouring rain. The contrast with the lush green of Epping Forest was startling. The rain brightened the varied shades of the fresh foliage and washed the dust and soot of the nearby city off the grass.<br>The driver was a uniformed constable, PC Stock, a pal of Ernie Piper&#x2019;s. A Londoner, he knew the lanes, footpaths, and bridle paths of the Forest like the back of his hand, according to Piper. He had grown up in Walthamstow and misspent many happy hours of his youth playing truant in the woods and streams.<br>Alec had no intention of wandering about in the rain looking for the informal burial ground. The Essex detective from whom he was taking over the case, disgruntled no doubt, had given the vaguest of directions: &#x201c;Broad Wood, towards the middle, you can&#x2019;t miss it.&#x201d; Broad Wood appeared on the map to cover nearly two hundred acres, with no defined boundaries. With Stock&#x2019;s assistance, they had a better chance of finding the right spot without fighting through thickets of brambles and hawthorn and holly on the way.<br>Tom, sitting next to Alec in the back seat, said with a gusty sigh, &#x201c;Me and the missus used to come out here weekends and bank holidays when we were courting.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not in weather like this, I bet, Sarge,&#x201d; said Piper from the front seat.<br>&#x201c;It was always sunny back then, lad.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Back before the Ice Age, that&#x2019;d be?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you let the missus hear you say that if you ever want to taste her steak and kidney pud again!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, Sarge, please, Sarge, you&#x2019;re not going to tell on me, are you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Watch it, laddie. Too cheeky by half, you are.&#x201d;<br>He was lucky to have a team so well attuned to each other, Alec thought. Besides being pleasant to work with, it made them work together more efficiently. Ernie Piper, neat in his blue serge, was shaping up nicely and might be encouraged to take his sergeant&#x2019;s exams soon. Tring, an awe-inspiring mountain in tan and yellow checks, didn&#x2019;t aspire to rise above his present rank. He was extremely good at what he did but not sufficiently imaginative to take the lead in a major case.<br>And it sounded as if they had a major case on their hands. Three bodies&#x2014;though as yet he had no reason to believe they were associated in anything but proximity.<br>Stock turned into a narrow lane, not much more than a cart-track, no different, as far as Alec could tell from half a dozen they had passed. It was gravelled but not paved, with grass growing down the middle between the ruts. Stock took a right-hand branch. &#x201c;This should do it, sir. Yes, look, there&#x2019;s a bloke waiting for us.&#x201d;<br>A constable in a shiny uniform cape stood on the verge waving at them. Stock pulled up beside him with rather more verve than strictly necessary, splashing mud on the man&#x2019;s already muddy boots.<br>He didn&#x2019;t even glance down, apparently already too sodden to notice. He stepped over to the rear window and stooped to look in as Alec rolled it down a couple of inches.<br>&#x201c;DCI Fletcher,&#x201d; he announced himself. &#x201c;Which way from here?&#x201d;<br>With a sloppy salute, the man said in the flat tones of Essex, &#x201c;PC Elliot, sir. Sorry, sir, this is as close as you can drive. You&#x2019;ll &#x2019;ave to walk from here.&#x201d; Rain dripped from his helmet and must be dripping down the back of his neck, if not streaming down the sides, too.<br>Stock twisted to say over his shoulder, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a ride&#x2014;a bridleway&#x2014;just a hundred yards farther on, sir. It&#x2019;s wide enough to drive, easy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Curves off in the wrong direction. &#x2019;Sides, like as not you&#x2019;d get stuck in the mud. And the brook&#x2019;s up. There&#x2019;s a footpath here, sir. I&#x2019;ll show you the way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll walk,&#x201d; said Alec, closing the window and opening the door. He settled his trilby more firmly on his head, turned up the collar of his mac, and started to get out.<br>&#x201c;Hold on, Chief!&#x201d; Ernie Piper was behind the car already, reaching into the boot for their umbrellas and Wellingtons. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to get out till you&#x2019;ve got these on. Knee-deep in mud before we even get into the Forest.&#x201d; A thoroughgoing city-dweller, he sounded disgusted, and had come prepared, having put on his boots while still in the car. He squelched round to hand Alec his.<br>Pulling them on, Alec said, &#x201c;Stock, we&#x2019;ll go ahead. You&#x2019;d better drive on a little and pull the car off the road, out of the way, though I don&#x2019;t imagine this road sees much traffic in this sort of weather.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want me to stay with the car, sir?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, you can follow us, if you think you can find the way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find you, sir, don&#x2019;t you worry.&#x201d;<br>The footpath was less muddy than the lane, being carpeted with last year&#x2019;s fallen leaves on top of a thick mulch of the leaves of centuries. Epping Forest had been a Royal hunting preserve, never set to the plough, though local villagers had always been allowed to coppice the trees. When the City of London took it over in the middle of the nineteenth century, the coppicing had been stopped. As a result the older hornbeams, beeches, and oaks were strange creatures with short, thick boles sprouting branches like Struwwelpeter&#x2019;s hair.<br>Between these had grown up an underlayer of their offspring mixed with hawthorn, holly, and service tree. A carpet of bluebells suggested that the sky had come down to earth, leaving a grey gloom above. Squirrels dashed up trees to chitter at the invaders, but the birds were too busy feeding nestlings to fall silent as they passed, in spite of the warning screech of a jay.<br>On fine weekends and holidays, well served by omnibuses and several tube stations, the Forest swarmed with escapees from the city. These tended to stick to the established trails and clearings, leaving much of the rest a practically impenetrable tangle of vegetation.<br>Squishing along the footpath on the heels of the local constable, Alec eyed the dripping jungle on either side with deep misgivings.<br>&#x201c;Strewth!&#x201d; said Tom, behind him. &#x201c;How did anyone manage to lug three bodies off the beaten path through that lot?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And find enough clear ground to bury &#x2019;em!&#x201d; Piper added from the rear.<br>&#x201c;I imagine it was a dog that found the first grave, Elliot?&#x201d; Alec asked.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I heard, sir. A Mr. Webster&#x2019;s Jack Russell.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;d take a Jack Russell to get in there,&#x201d; Tom muttered.<br>&#x201c;Presumably Webster went to see what his dog had found,&#x201d; Alec pointed out, &#x201c;and the local coppers, too. The site must be accessible, though perhaps not to someone of your size.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all right, Chief. I&#x2019;ll stay on the path and you can tell me all about it later.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s plenty of room, sir,&#x201d; said Elliot. Tom sighed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not in the thickest part&#x2014;stands to reason or they couldn&#x2019;t&#x2019;ve buried them&#x2014;and a lot got trampled down when we was searching.&#x201d;<br>Alec echoed Tom&#x2019;s sigh. It was inevitable, nothing more than he had expected, but he wondered how many clues had disappeared into the leaf-mould. The local detectives who so resented the Yard being called in seldom considered the difficulties of coming to a case where evidence had already been mishandled or lost, witnesses antagonised, suspects alarmed.<br>The path they were on at one point ran near the swollen stream Elliot had warned of. Brown and turbulent it raced down the slope towards the Lea.<br>&#x201c;Good job your pal didn&#x2019;t try to drive us through that,&#x201d; Tom remarked to Piper. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve been stuck for a month of Sundays, if it didn&#x2019;t wash us down to the Thames.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t like the look of it myself,&#x201d; Piper agreed.<br>Constable Stock caught up with them in time to hear this. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll go down fast soon as this rain stops,&#x201d; he said, sounding a bit resentful.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not coming down as hard,&#x201d; Tom said peaceably.<br>What could be seen of the sky through the trees was now light grey instead of dark grey. Leaves still dripped and occasional cascades descended on them, but as they emerged into a grassy glade, it was obvious that the worst was over.<br>A wide ride, more cart-track than bridleway, entered the clearing at an angle to their path. Muddy ruts filled with water suggested that it was occasionally used by vehicles. The ruts crossed the clearing and ran into the woods opposite. The footpath petered out, as if, having brought its followers to the glade, it abandoned them to decide for themselves which way to go.<br>&#x201c;That way.&#x201d; Elliot pointed at a caped constable standing on the edge of what looked like an unbroken wall of greenery.<br>They altered course to trudge in his direction.<br>&#x201c;Blimey,&#x201d; said Tom, at Alec&#x2019;s side, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve left the perishing dog to find its own way home.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be as bad as it looks from here. Someone had already lugged three bodies through, remember.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Less they came from the other side,&#x201d; Piper suggested.<br>&#x201c;Nah,&#x201d; said Elliot, &#x201c;Inspector Gant reckons it&#x2019;d be impossible.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Tom, at his most inscrutable.<br>They reached the cross-track. Alec stopped to study the ruts.<br>&#x201c;Horse and cart,&#x201d; said Tom, &#x201c;not a motor vehicle.

But under this fa�ade lies a country still haunted by its years of terror. <p>Joel Brinkley won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting in Cambodia on the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime that killed one quarter of the nation's population during its years in power. In 1992, the world came together to help pull the small nation out of the mire. Cambodia became a United Nations protectorate--the first and only time the UN tried something so ambitious. What did the new, democratically-elected government do with this unprecedented gift? </p><p>In 2008 and 2009, Brinkley returned to Cambodia to find out. He discovered a population in the grip of a venal government. He learned that one-third to one-half of Cambodians who lived through the Khmer Rouge era have P.T.S.D.--and its afflictions are being passed to the next generation. His extensive close-up reporting in <i>Cambodia's Curse</i> illuminates the country, its people, and the deep historical roots of its modern-day behavior.</p></p><p><b>Joel Brinkley</b>, a professor of journalism at Stanford University, is a twenty-three-year veteran of the <i>New York Times</i>. He has worked in more than fifty nations and writes a nationally syndicated op-ed column on foreign policy. He won the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting in 1980 and was twice a finalist for an investigative reporting Pulitzer in the following years. This is his fifth book.Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist Brinkley takes on the pricey pitfalls of nation building and the labyrinth of centuries-old political corruption in this riveting piece of literary reportage. At once a tale of human tragedy and a primer on the future of Western engagement with developing&#x2014;and autocratic&#x2014;countries, the book offers a rare look inside a country beleaguered by poverty and imprisoned by patronage and venal leadership since the 13th century; traumatized by colonialism, Pol Pot's brutal Khmer Rouge, and the genocide he unleashed (and later by Vietnam, which overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979). Brinkley is merciless in his critique of both Cambodia's leadership as well as the folly of donor countries that placed faith in the U.N. to bring Cambodia into a modern, democratic era. He expresses empathy for "the most abused people in the world," many of whom are in the grip of post-traumatic stress disorders after Pol Pot's reign of terror, but he saves his mercenary eye for the corrupt leaders, including present dictator Hun Sen, who continue to suppress and exploit the country's resources and young, vital population.

In 1989 Inspector Morse is taken to Oxford&#39;s John Radcliffe Hospital with a perforated ulcer. As Morse begins his recovery he comes across an account of the investigation of Joanna&#39;s death and subsequent murder trial.</p><p>It is only to entertain himself in the hospital that the impatient Inspector Morse opens the little book called Murder on the Oxford Canal. But so fascinating is the story it tells--of the notorious 1859 murder of Joanna Franks aboard the canal boat Barbara Bray--that not even Morse&#39;s attractive nurses can distract him from it. Was Joanna really raped and murdered by fellow passengers? Morse believes the men hanged for the crime were innocent. Now, in one of the most dazzling investigations of his career, Morse sets out to piece together the shattered past, hoping to expose the shocking truth about the Barbara Bray--and a beautiful wench who is journeying towards her death."INSPECTOR MORSE . . .

A correspondent for <i>The Atlantic Monthly,</i> Langewiesche was undaunted by the physical hardships of the trip, instead focusing on the beleaguered towns and people that survive along the desert's fringes and in its oases. As he discusses subjects as various as adobe walls and the history of prehistoric Tassili cave painters, he introduces old friends and people met by chance.

Born a French aristocrat, he lost nearly his entire family in the Reign of Terror, and he spent most of his adult life struggling for liberty under the unsuccessful regimes of nineteenth-century France.&nbsp;<br><br>At age twenty-five he travelled to America&nbsp;and encountered democracy for the first time. This firsthand experience contributed to his incisive writing on liberty and democracy. The<i> ancien r�gime</i> launched the scholarly study of the French Revolution, and <i>Democracy in America</i> remains the best book ever written by a European about the United States. This is a brilliant account of his life.</p><p><p>A Conversation with Hugh Brogan</p><p></p><p>Q: Tocqueville spent less than a year in America, and yet he is perhaps the most widely quoted observer of American culture and politics. How do you account for this?</p><p></p><p>A: Tocqueville did not waste his ten months in the U.S.: he observed, questioned, and reflected ceaselessly. When he returned to France, he continued to study America, through books, documents, and discussion, for nearly eight years. But the most important answer--though it may injure American pride--is that his subject was not America but democracy. His book is informed by lengthy study and reflection on France and Britain as well as the U.S. This gives his conclusions enormous weight.</p><p></p><p>Q: In what ways did his personal experience shape his political outlook?</p><p></p><p>A: Tocqueville knew himself to be a member of a defeated caste--he was born into the high nobility of France. He accepted that the changes wrought by the French Revolution were irreversible and as a matter of justice he welcomed an increased social and political power of the middle class. His thought was dominated by what he called the advance of democracy.&#x201d; But increasingly he realized that pressing behind the middle class was the working class, infected with ideas about equality of opportunity and equality between men and women. He was extremely reluctant to acquiesce in this further revolution.</p><p></p><p>Q: Tocqueville&#x2019;s family was deeply scarred by the Reign of Terror; how did Tocqueville believe such atrocities could be prevented?</p><p></p><p>A: Tocqueville believed that political atrocities of all kinds were the result of the folly and impatience of human beings. He hoped that through persuasive demonstration they might be convinced to know better and behave better. He believed that a democratic system such as he had observed in America was the best way of educating the people and the best protector of their real interests. A true liberal, he did not believe that revolution, aggressive war, dictatorship, or demagogic humbug could ever be justified as instruments of human progress. Two hundred years after his birth, we can see that he was right: his conceptions of democratic justice are those to which most of the world nowadays pays lip service, even if at times they still seem unattainable.</p><b>Hugh Brogan</b>&nbsp;held the R.

"One wonders if women still exist, if they will always exist, whether or not it is desirable that they should ...," she says in this comprehensive treatise on women. She weaves together history, philosophy, economics, biology, and a host of other disciplines to show women's place in the world and to postulate on the power of sexuality. This is a powerful piece of writing in a time before "feminism" was even a phrase, much less a movement.Introduction by Margaret Crosland; Translation by H. M. Parshley</p><h2>Pinkerton, Behave!</h2><p>His behavior may be rather unconventional, but Pinkerton the dog proves it doesn&#39;t really matter.</p><p>Steven Kellogg is a beloved author and illustrator who has published than 100 picture books, including the classics <i>The Mysterious Tadpole, Can I Keep Him?, The Island of the Skog, Is Your Mama a Llama?,</i> and this book, <i>Pinkerton, Behave!,</i> which was on <i>Horn Book</i> and <i>Booklist&#x2019;s</i> Best of the Year lists and led to four sequels. A winner of the Regina Medal for his lifetime contribution to children&#x2019;s literature, Steven Kellogg&#x2019;s books have received numerous accolades, such as being named Reading Rainbow featured selections and winning the <i>Boston Globe-Horn Book</i> Award, the Irma Simonton Black Award, the IRA-CBC Children&#x2019;s Choice Award, and the <i>Parents&#x2019; Choice</i> Award.K-Gr 2&#x2014;Pinkerton, Behave! has been adored by young readers and their families for 35 years, so the author's decision to revise and reillustrate the story of an enthusiastic Great Dane gives fans a pleasant excuse to take another look. Pinkerton has a kind of auditory dyslexia: when told to fetch, he attacks; when commanded to come, he goes; asked to bark loudly, he displays affection. After his expulsion from obedience school, the mother and daughter who are his family learn to turn his unique responses to his best advantage, setting an excellent example for Pinkerton-like humans and their loved ones. Some of Kellogg's changes are cosmetic&#x2014;different colors, perspectives, and phrasing&#x2014;while others are more substantive. Those who read both versions will notice that the burglar no longer carries a gun and the mother now holds a cell phone. Children may enjoy comparing the old and new versions, both of which are wonderfully silly, clever, and entertaining.&#x2014;Susan Weitz, formerly at Spencer-Van Etten School District, Spencer, NY</p><h2>Fantastic Four by Jonathan Hickman, Vol. 2</h2><p>It's a new era for the FF - in every way imaginable! Black Bolt has returned from seeming death; Dr. Doom, the Wizard, the Mad Thinker and Diablo have joined the Future Foundation; and four alternate-reality Reed Richards are scheming to ignite war among the fabled Four Cities.

This handsome but slim volume, abetted by Eaglesham&#x2019;s lavishly detailed artwork and impressively imagined settings, is not a grand reinvention on its own, but it is a fine diversion featuring some fun mainstream superhero sci-fi adventures. --Jesse Karp</p><h2>Boussole: Prix Goncourt 2015</h2><p>WINNER FRANCE'S TOP LITERARY PRIZE, LE PRIX GONCOURT 2015<br><br>This is about one man, an Austrian musicologist called Franz Ritter, who is currently ill with an unspecified disease, who throws away the tablets his doctor gives him and lies awake at night, thinking about various things. These include his unrequited love for the French woman Sarah, his wide-ranging knowledge and views on primarily Western classical music but also some Middle Eastern music and, above all, on matters relating to the Middle East and, in particular, the relationship between Europe and the Middle East. He himself has travelled extensively in the Middle East (though not as much as Sarah) and is very knowledgeable about the subject and about the various Westerners who travelled there and were influenced by that part of the world. He gives us a wide-ranging selection of often highly opinionated anecdotes on the topic, from the various European women who travelled and lived in the Middle East to those writers and musicians who were very much influenced by it, from Balzac, the first Western novelist to insert a piece of Arabic into his novels to composers such as Liszt and Bart�k whose music was influenced by the Middle East. He damns Wagner and praises Beethoven (not least because he left Germany, preferring to live in Vienna) and even receives a compass modelled on Beethoven s as a gift from Sarah, a compass which points not North but East. Above all it is a wonderful and learned recitation of the intellectual history of Europe and its association with the Middle East, told in a non-learned manner, as well as a discussion of music and musicology, as Ritter lies in bed in his flat in Vienna, listening to his neighbour, Herr Gruber, wandering around.</p><p>N� en 1972, Mathias Enard a �tudi� le persan et l&#39;arabe et fait de longs s�jours au Moyen-Orient.

City cop Andy Rusch is under pressure to solve the crime and captivated by the victim&#39;s beautiful girlfriend. But it is difficult to catch a killer, let alone get the girl, in crazy streets crammed full of people. The planet&#39;s population has exploded. The 35 million inhabitants of New York City run their TVs off pedal power, riot for water, loot and trample for lentil &#39;steaks&#39; and are controlled by sinister barbed wire dropped from the sky. Written in 1966 and set in 1999, &#34;Make Room! Make Room!&#34; is a witty and unnerving story about stretching the earth&#39;s resources, and the human spirit, to breaking point.</p><p><b>Harry Harrison</b>, author of innumerable science fiction novels and stories, divides his time between Ireland and California.Chapter 1<br>The August sun struck in through the open window and burned on Andrew Rusch&#x2019;s bare legs until discomfort dragged him awake from the depths of heavy sleep. Only slowly did he become aware of the heat and the damp and gritty sheet beneath his body. He rubbed at his gummed-shut eyelids, then lay there, staring up at the cracked and stained plaster of the ceiling, only half awake and experiencing a feeling of dislocation, not knowing in those first waking moments just where he was, although he had lived in this room for over seven years. He yawned and the odd sensation slipped away while he groped for the watch that he always put on the chair next to the bed, then he yawned again as he blinked at the hands mistily seen behind the scratched crystal. Seven . . . seven o&#x2019;clock in the morning, and there was a little number 9 in the middle of the square window. Monday, the ninth of August, 1999&#x2014;and hot as a furnace already, with the city still imbedded in the heat wave that had baked and suffocated New York for the past ten days. Andy scratched at a trickle of perspiration on his side, then moved his legs out of the patch of sunlight and bunched the pillow up under his neck. From the other side of the thin partition that divided the room in half there came a clanking whir that quickly rose to a high-pitched drone.<br>&#x201c;Morning . . .&#x201d; he shouted over the sound, then began coughing. Still coughing he reluctantly stood and crossed the room to draw a glass of water from the wall tank; it came out in a thin, brownish trickle. He swallowed it, then rapped the dial on the tank with his knuckles and the needle bobbed up and down close to the Empty mark. It needed filling, he would have to see to that before he signed in at four o&#x2019;clock at the precinct. The day had begun.<br>A full-length mirror with a crack running down it was fixed to the front of the hulking wardrobe and he poked his face close to it, rubbing at his bristly jaw. He would have to shave before he went in. No one should ever look at himself in the morning, naked and revealed, he decided with distaste, frowning at the dead white of his skin and the slight bow to his legs that was usually concealed by his pants. And how did he manage to have ribs that stuck out like those of a starved horse, as well as a growing potbelly&#x2014;both at the same time? He kneaded the soft flesh and thought that it must be the starchy diet, that and sitting around on his chunk most of the time. But at least the fat wasn&#x2019;t showing on his face. His forehead was a little higher each year, but wasn&#x2019;t too obvious as long as his hair was cropped short. You have just turned thirty, he thought to himself, and the wrinkles are already starting around your eyes. And your nose is too big&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t it Uncle Brian who always said that was because there was Welsh blood in the family? And your canine teeth are a little too obvious so when you smile you look a bit like a hyena. You&#x2019;re a handsome devil, Andy Rusch, and when was the last time you had a date? He scowled at himself, then went to look for a handkerchief to blow his impressive Welsh nose.<br>There was just a single pair of clean undershorts in the drawer and he pulled them on; that was another thing he had to remember today, to get some washing done. The squealing whine was still coming from the other side of the partition as he pushed through the connecting door.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to give yourself a coronary, Sol,&#x201d; he told the gray-bearded man who was perched on the wheelless bicycle, pedaling so industriously that perspiration ran down his chest and soaked into the bath towel that he wore tied around his waist.<br>&#x201c;Never a coronary,&#x201d; Solomon Kahn gasped out, pumping steadily. &#x201c;I been doing this every day for so long that my ticker would miss it if I stopped. And no cholesterol in my arteries either since regular flushing with alcohol takes care of that. And no lung cancer since I couldn&#x2019;t afford to smoke even if I wanted to, which I don&#x2019;t.

Do you have an ice cube to spare?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Take two&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a hot day. And don&#x2019;t leave the door open too long.&#x201d;<br>Andy opened the small refrigerator that squatted against the wall and quickly took out the plastic container of margarine, then squeezed two ice cubes from the tray into a glass and slammed the door. He filled the glass with water from the wall tank and put it on the table next to the margarine. &#x201c;Have you eaten yet?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll join you, these things should be charged by now.&#x201d;<br>Sol stopped pedaling and the whine died away to a moan, then vanished. He disconnected the wires from the electrical generator that was geared to the rear axle of the bike, and carefully coiled them up next to the four black automobile storage batteries that were racked on top of the refrigerator. Then, after wiping his hands on his soiled towel sarong, he pulled out one of the bucket seats salvaged from an ancient 1975 Ford, and sat down across the table from Andy.<br>&#x201c;I heard the six o&#x2019;clock news,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The Eldsters are organizing another protest march today on relief headquarters. That&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;ll see coronaries!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t, thank God, I&#x2019;m not on until four and Union Square isn&#x2019;t in our precinct.&#x201d; He opened the breadbox and took out one of the six-inch-square red crackers, then pushed the box over to Sol. He spread margarine thinly on it and took a bite, wrinkling his nose as he chewed. &#x201c;I think this margarine has turned.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How can you tell?&#x201d; Sol grunted, biting into one of the dry crackers. &#x201c;Anything made from motor oil and whale blubber is turned to begin with.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Now you begin to sound like a naturist,&#x201d; Andy said, washing his cracker down with cold water. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s hardly any flavor at all to the fats made from petrochemicals and you know there aren&#x2019;t any whales left so they can&#x2019;t use blubber&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just good chlorella oil.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Whales, plankton, herring oil, it&#x2019;s all the same. Tastes fishy. I&#x2019;ll take mine dry so I don&#x2019;t grow no fins.&#x201d; There was a sudden staccato rapping on the door and he groaned. &#x201c;Not yet eight o&#x2019;clock and already they are after you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It could be anything,&#x201d; Andy said, starting for the door.<br>&#x201c;It could be but it&#x2019;s not, that&#x2019;s the callboy&#x2019;s knock and you know it as well as I do and I bet you dollars to doughnuts that&#x2019;s just who it is. See?&#x201d; He nodded with gloomy satisfaction when Andy unlocked the door and they saw the skinny, bare-legged messenger standing in the dark hall.<br>&#x201c;What do you want, Woody?&#x201d; Andy asked.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019; wan&#x2019; no-fin,&#x201d; Woody lisped over his bare gums. Though he was in his early twenties he didn&#x2019;t have a tooth in his head. &#x201c;Lieutenan&#x2019; says bring, I bring.&#x201d; He handed Andy the message board with his name written on the outside.<br>Andy turned toward the light and opened it, reading the lieutenant&#x2019;s spiky scrawl on the slate, then took the chalk and scribbled his initials after it and returned it to the messenger. He closed the door behind him and went back to finish his breakfast, frowning in thought.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look at me that way,&#x201d; Sol said, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t send the message. Am I wrong in guessing it&#x2019;s not the most pleasant of news?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Eldsters, they&#x2019;re jamming the Square already and the precinct needs reinforcements.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But why you? This sounds like a job for the harness bulls.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Harness bulls! Where do you get that medieval slang? Of course they need patrolmen for the crowd, but there have to be detectives there to spot known agitators, pickpockets, purse-grabbers and the rest. It&#x2019;ll be murder in that park today. I have to check in by nine, so I have enough time to bring up some water first.&#x201d;<br>Andy dressed slowly in slacks and a loose sport shirt, then put a pan of water on the windowsill to warm in the sun. He took the two five-gallon plastic jerry cans, and when he went out Sol looked up from the TV set, glancing over the top of his old-fashioned glasses.<br>&#x201c;When you bring back the water I&#x2019;ll fix you a drink&#x2014;or do you think it is too early?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not the way I feel today, it&#x2019;s not.&#x201d;<br>The hall was ink black once the door had closed behind him and he felt his way carefully along the wall to the stairs, cursing and almost falling when he stumbled over a heap of refuse someone had thrown there. Two flights down a window had been knocked through the wall and enough light came in to show him the way down the last two flights to the street. After the damp hallway the heat of Twenty-fifth Street hit him in a musty wave, a stifling miasma compounded of decay, dirt and unwashed humanity. He had to make his way through the women who already filled the steps of the building, walking carefully so that he didn&#x2019;t step on the children who were playing below. The sidewalk was still in shadow but so jammed with people that he walked in the street, well away from the curb to avoid the rubbish and litter banked high there. Days of heat had softened the tar so that it gave underfoot, then clutched at the soles of his shoes. There was the usual line leading to the columnar red water point on the corner of Seventh Avenue, but it broke up with angry shouts and some waved fists just a...</p><h2>Memories of God: Theological Reflections on a Life</h2><p><p> When the hearing and telling of stories captures our imaginations, we are enabled at the deepest level to take our lives seriously. By envisioning other worlds, we are rendered capable of listening to God and to ourselves, and of growing in God's image. </p> <p> This is how Roberta Bondi comes to tell stories in this book, stories that were formed in a life of prayer. They reflect on life's turning points and how these are made both more difficult and more open to grace by the Christian understandings of naming God as father and mother; the significance of rationality; and the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus. </p> <p> Bondi discovered that what she had regarded as her personal, private stories were not really so private or idiosyncratic after all when they were seen in the intersection of her beliefs, family experience, and cultural expectations. We are drawn into thelogical reflection on the stories of one woman only to discover there our own stories, our own memories, all stored in the memory of God.</p></p><p>Roberta C. Bondi is Professor of Church History at Candler School of Theology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. She is the author of Night on the Flint River, In Ordinary Time, Memories of God, A Place to Pray, and Nick the Cat (forthcoming), all published by Abingdon Press.Bondi, a professor of church history, shares her own spiritual journey in these lyrical and meditative stories. Here we travel with Bondi as she searches out new meanings for her long-held beliefs in the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. We accompany her as she learns to pray from the early Syriac Christian theologian Philoxenus of Mabbug, and moments of grace shine through the dark glass of pain she encounters as a woman theologian in a male theological world. Bondi's narrative theology is an intoxicating blend of head and heart.

I thought that was in very bad taste. She had her scrapbook laid out on my mahogany coffee table, newspaper clippings neatly arranged in chronological order, the bald statements of death recording all of her Feedings. Nina Drayton&#x2019;s smile was as radiant as ever, but her pale blue eyes showed no hint of warmth.</p> <p>&#x201c;We should wait for Willi,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course, Melanie. You&#x2019;re right, as always. How silly of me. I know the rules.&#x201d; Nina stood and began walking around the room, idly touching the furnishings or exclaiming softly over a ceramic statuette or piece of needlepoint. This part of the house had once been the conservatory, but now I used it as my sewing room. Green plants still caught the morning light. The sunlight made it a warm, cozy place in the daytime, but now that winter had come the room was too chilly to use at night. Nor did I like the sense of darkness closing in against all those panes of glass.</p> <p>&#x201c;I love this house,&#x201d; said Nina. She turned and smiled at me. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you how much I look forward to coming back to Charleston. We should hold all of our reunions here.&#x201d;</p> <p>I knew how much Nina loathed this city, this house.</p> <p>&#x201c;Willi would be hurt,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You know how he likes to show off his place in Beverly Hills. And his new girlfriends.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And boyfriends,&#x201d; said Nina and laughed. Of all the changes and darkenings in Nina, her laugh has been least affected. It was still the husky but childish laugh that I had first heard so long ago. It had drawn me to her then&#x2014;one lonely, adolescent girl responding to the warmth of another like a moth to a flame. Now it only served to chill me and put me even more on my guard. Enough moths had been drawn to Nina&#x2019;s flame over the many decades.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send for tea,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>Mr. Thorne brought the tea in my best Wedgwood china. Nina and I sat in the slowly moving squares of sunlight and spoke softly of nothing important; mutually ignorant comments on the economy, references to books which the other had not got around to reading, and sympathetic murmurs about the low class of persons one meets while flying these days. Someone peering in from the garden might have thought they were seeing an aging but attractive niece visiting her favorite aunt. (I draw the line at suggesting that anyone would mistake us for mother and daughter.) People usually consider me a well-dressed if not stylish person. Heaven knows I have paid enough to have the wool skirts and silk blouses mailed from Scotland and France. But next to Nina I always felt dowdy. This day she wore an elegant, light blue dress which must have cost several thousand dollars if I had identified the designer correctly. The color made her complexion seem even more perfect than usual and brought out the blue of her eyes. Her hair had gone as gray as mine, but somehow she managed to get away with wearing it long and tied back with a single barrette. It looked youthful and chic on Nina and made me feel that my short, artificial curls were glowing with a blue rinse.</p> <p>Few would suspect that I was four years younger than Nina. Time had been kind to her. And she had Fed more often.</p> <p>She set down her cup and saucer and moved aimlessly around the room again. It was not like Nina to show such signs of nervousness. She stopped in front of the glass display case. Her gaze passed over the Hummels, the pewter pieces, and then stopped in surprise.</p> <p>&#x201c;Good heavens, Melanie. A pistol! What an odd place to put an old pistol.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an heirloom,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Quite expensive. And you&#x2019;re right, it is a silly place to keep it. But it&#x2019;s the only case I have in the house with a lock on it and Mrs. Hodges often brings her grandchildren when she visits&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You mean it&#x2019;s loaded?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, of course not,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;But children should not play with such things&#x2026;&#x201d; I trailed off lamely. Nina nodded but did not bother to conceal the condescension in her smile. She went to look out the south window into the garden.</p> <p>Damn her. It said volumes about Nina Drayton that she did not recognize that pistol.</p> <p>On the day he was killed, Charles Edgar Larchmont had been my beau for precisely five months and two days. There had been no formal announcement, but we were to be married. Those five months had been a microcosm of the era itself&#x2014;naive, flirtatious, formal to the point of preciosity, and romantic. Most of all romantic. Romantic in the worst sense of the word; dedicated to saccharine or insipid ideals that only an adolescent&#x2014;or an adolescent society&#x2014;would strive to maintain. We were children playing with loaded weapons.</p> <p>Nina, she was Nina Hawkins then, had her own beau&#x2014;a tall, awkward, but well-meaning Englishman named Roger Harrison. Mr. Harrison had met Nina in London a year earlier during the first stages of the Hawkins&#x2019;s Grand Tour. Declaring himself smitten&#x2014;another absurdity of those childish times&#x2014;the tall Englishman had followed her from one European capital to another until, after being firmly reprimanded by Nina&#x2019;s father (an unimaginative little milliner who was constantly on the defensive about his doubtful social status), Harrison returned to London to &#x201c;settle his affairs&#x201d; only to show up some months later in New York just as Nina was being packed off to her aunt&#x2019;s home in Charleston in order to terminate yet another flirtation. Still undaunted, the clumsy Englishman followed her south, ever mindful of the protocols and restrictions of the day.</p> <p>We were a gay group. The day after I met Nina at Cousin Celia&#x2019;s June Ball, the four of us were taking a hired boat up the Cooper River for a picnic on Daniel Island. Roger Harrison, serious and solemn on every topic, was a perfect foil for Charles&#x2019;s irreverent sense of humor. Nor did Roger seem to mind the good-natured jesting since he was soon joining in the laughter with his peculiar haw-haw-haw.</p> <p>Nina loved it all. Both gentlemen showered attention on her and while Charles never failed to show the primacy of his affection for me, it was understood by all that Nina Hawkins was one of those young women who invariably becomes the center of male gallantry and attention in any gathering. Nor were the social strata of Charleston blind to the combined charm of our foursome. For two months of that now distant summer, no party was complete, no excursion adequately planned, and no occasion considered a success unless we four merry pranksters were invited and had chosen to attend. Our happy dominance of the youthful social scene was so pronounced that Cousins Celia and Loraine wheedled their parents into leaving two weeks early for their annual August sojourns in Maine.</p> <p>I am not sure when Nina and I came up with the idea of the duel. Perhaps it was during one of the long, hot nights when the other &#x201c;slept over&#x201d;&#x2014;creeping into the other&#x2019;s bed, whispering and giggling, stifling our laughter when the rustling of starched uniforms betrayed the presence of our colored maids moving through the darkened halls. In any case, the idea was the natural outgrowth of the romantic pretensions of the time. The picture of Charles and Roger actually dueling over some abstract point of honor related to us thrilled both of us in a physical way which I recognize now as a simple form of sexual titillation.</p> <p>It would have been harmless except for our Ability. We had been so successful in our manipulation of male behavior&#x2014;a manipulation which was both expected and encouraged in those days&#x2014;that neither of us had yet suspected that there lay anything beyond the ordinary in the way we could translate our whims into other people&#x2019;s actions. The field of parapsychology did not exist then: or rather, it existed only in the rappings and knockings of parlor game s�ances. At any rate, we amused ourselves with whispered fantasies for several weeks and then one of us&#x2014;or perhaps both of us&#x2014;used the Ability to translate the fantasy into reality.</p> <p>In a sense it was our first Feeding.</p> <p>I do not remember the purported cause of the quarrel, perhaps some deliberate misinterpretation of one of Charles&#x2019;s jokes. I can not recall who Charles and Roger arranged to have serve as seconds on that illegal outing. I do remember the hurt and confused expression on Roger Harrison&#x2019;s face during those few days. It was a caricature of ponderous dullness, the confusion of a man who finds himself in a situation not of his making and from which he cannot escape. I remember Charles and his mercurial swings of mood&#x2014;the bouts of humor, periods of black anger, and the tears and kisses the night before the duel.</p> <p>I remember with great clarity the beauty of that morning. Mists were floating up from the river and diffusing the rays of the rising sun as we rode out to the dueling field. I remember Nina reaching over and squeezing my hand with an impetuous excitement that was communicated through my body like an electric shock.</p> <p>Much of the rest of that morning is missing. Perhaps in the intensity of that first, subconscious Feeding I literally lost consciousness as I was engulfed in the waves of fear, excitement, pride&#x2026;of maleness&#x2026;that was emanating from our two beaus as they faced death on that lovely morning. I remember experiencing the shock of realizing this is really happening as I shared the tread of high boots through the grass. Someone was calling off the paces. I dimly recall the weight of the pistol in my hand&#x2026;Charles&#x2019;s hand I think, I will never know for sure&#x2026;and a second of cold clarity before an explosion broke the connection and the acrid smell of gunpowder brought me back to myself.</p> <p>It was Charles who died. I have never been able to forget the incredible quantities of blood which poured from the small, round hole in his breast. His white shirt was crimson by the time I reached him. There had been no blood in our fantasies. Nor had there been the sight of Charles with his head lolling, mouth dribbling saliva onto his bloodied chest while his eyes rolled back to show the whites like two eggs embedded in his skull. Roger Harrison was sobbing as Charles breathed his final, shuddering gasps on that field of innocence.</p> <p>I remember nothing at all about the confused hours which followed. It was the next morning that I opened my cloth bag to find Charles&#x2019;s pistol lying with my things. Why would I have kept that revolver? If I had wished to take something from my fallen lover as a sign of remembrance, why that alien piece of metal? Why pry from his dead fingers the symbol of our thoughtless sin?</p> <p>It said volumes about Nina that she did not recognize that pistol.</p> <p>&#x201c;Willi&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was not Mr. Thorne announcing the arrival of our guest but Nina&#x2019;s &#x201c;amanuensis,&#x201d; the loathsome Miss Barrett Kramer. Kramer&#x2019;s appearance was as unisex as her name; short cropped, black hair, powerful shoulders, and a blank, aggressive gaze which I associated with lesbians and criminals. She looked to be in her mid-thirties.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you, Barrett, dear,&#x201d; said Nina.</p> <p>I went to greet Willi, but Mr. Thorne had already let him in and we met in the hallway.</p> <p>&#x201c;Melanie! You look marvelous! You grow younger each time I see you. Nina!&#x201d; The change in Willi&#x2019;s voice was evident. Men continued to be overpowered by their first sight of Nina after an absence. There were hugs and kisses. Willi himself looked more dissolute than ever. His alpaca sports coat was exquisitely tailored, his turtleneck sweater successfully concealed the eroded lines of his wattled neck, but when he swept off his jaunty sportscar cap the long strands of white hair he had brushed forward to hide his encroaching baldness were knocked into disarray. Willi&#x2019;s face was flushed with excitement, but there was also the telltale capillary redness about the nose and cheeks which spoke of too much liquor, too many drugs.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ladies, I think you&#x2019;ve met my associates&#x2026;Tom Reynolds and Jensen Luhar?&#x201d; The two men added to the crowd in my narrow hall. Mr. Reynolds was thin and blond, smiling with perfectly capped teeth. Mr. Luhar was a gigantic Negro, hulking forward with a sullen, bruised look on his coarse face. I was sure that neither Nina nor I had encountered these specific catspaws of Willi&#x2019;s before.</p> <p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we go into the parlor?&#x201d; I suggested. It was an awkward procession ending with the three of us seated on the heavily upholstered chairs surrounding the Georgian tea table which had been my grandmother&#x2019;s. &#x201c;More tea, please, Mr. Thorne.&#x201d; Miss Kramer took that as her cue to leave, but Willi&#x2019;s two pawns stood uncertainly by the door, shifting from foot to foot and glancing at the crystal on display as if their mere proximity could break something. I would not have been surprised if that had proven to be the case.</p> <p>&#x201c;Jensen!&#x201d; Willi snapped his fingers. The Negro hesitated and then brought forward an expensive leather attach� case. Willi set it on the tea table and clicked the catches open with his short, broad fingers. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you two see Miz Fuller&#x2019;s man about getting something to drink?&#x201d;</p> <p>When they were gone Willi shook his head and smiled at Nina. &#x201c;Sorry about that, love.&#x201d;</p> <p>Nina put her hand on Willi&#x2019;s sleeve. She leaned forward with an air of expectancy. &#x201c;Melanie wouldn&#x2019;t let me begin the Game without you. Wasn&#x2019;t that awful of me to want to start without you, Willi dear?&#x201d;</p> <p>Willi frowned. After fifty years he still bridled at being called Willi. In Los Angeles he was Big Bill Borden. When he returned to his native Germany&#x2014;which was not often because of the dangers involved&#x2014;he was once again Wilhelm von Borchert, lord of dark manor, forest, and hunt. But Nina had called him Willi when they had first met in 1925, in Vienna, and Willi he had remained.</p> <p>&#x201c;You begin, Willi,&#x201d; said Nina. &#x201c;You go first.&#x201d;</p> <p>I could remember the time when we would have spent the first few days of our reunion in conversation and catching up with each other&#x2019;s lives. Now there was not even time for small talk.</p> <p>Willi showed his teeth and removed news clippings, notebooks, and a stack of cassettes from his briefcase. No sooner had he covered the small table with his material than Mr. Thorne arrived with the tea and Nina&#x2019;s scrapbook from the sewing room. Willi brusquely cleared a small space.</p> <p>At first glance one might see certain similarities between Willi Borchert and Mr. Thorne. One would be mistaken. Both men tend to the florid, but Willi&#x2019;s complexion was the result of excess and emotion: Mr. Thorne had known neither of these for many years. Willi&#x2019;s balding was a patchy, self-consciously concealed thing&#x2014;a weasel with the mange&#x2014;while Mr. Thorne&#x2019;s bare head was smooth and unwrinkled. One could not imagine Mr. Thorne ever having had hair. Both men had gray eyes&#x2014;what a novelist would call cold, gray eyes&#x2014;but Mr. Thorne&#x2019;s eyes were cold with indifference, cold with a clarity coming from an absolute absence of troublesome emotion or thought. Willi&#x2019;s eyes were the cold of a blustery North Sea winter and were often clouded with shifting curtains of the emotions that controlled him&#x2014;pride, hatred, love of pain, the pleasures of destruction. Willi never referred to his use of the Ability as Feedings&#x2014;I was evidently the only one who thought in those terms&#x2014;but Willi sometimes talked of the Hunt. Perhaps it was the dark forests of his homeland that he thought of as he stalked his human quarry through the sterile streets of Los Angeles. Did Willi dream of the forest? I wondered. Did he look back to green wool hunting jackets, the applause of retainers, the gouts of blood from the dying boar? Or did Willi remember the slam of jackboots on cobblestones and the pounding of his lieutenants&#x2019; fists on doors? Perhaps Willi still associated his Hunt with the dark European ...</p></p><h2>Suicide of the West: The Meaning and Destiny of Liberalism</h2><p>James Burnham&#39;s 1964 classic, Suicide of the West, remains a startling account on the nature of the modern era. It offers a profound, in depth analysis of what is happening in the world today by putting into focus the intangible, often vague doctrine of American liberalism. It parallels the loosely defined liberal ideology rampant in American government and institutions, with the flow, ebb, growth, climax and the eventual decline and death of both ancient and modern civilizations. Its author maintains that western suicidal tendencies lie not so much in the lack of resources or military power, but through an erosion of intellectual, moral, and spiritual factors abundant in modern western society and the mainstay of liberal psychology. Devastating in its relentless dissection of the liberal syndrome, this book will lead many liberals to painful self-examination, buttress the thinking conservative&#39;s viewpoint, and incite others, no doubt, to infuriation. None can ignore it.</p><p></p><h2>The Novel (Interlink World Fiction)</h2><p>So begins Nawal El Saadawi&#39;s tenth novel. And indeed, when the famous Egyptian psychiatrist and writer released The Novel in 2005, it was banned all over the Arab world. But the novel inside The Novel is by a young woman-a woman who is only 23 years old, who has no family, no university degree, no national identity card, whose name does not appear on the lists of prominent women writers. A woman, that is, whose biography is as unlike Saadawi&#39;s own as possible, as if she has stripped herself of all the effects of her own worldly existence to explore something earlier, more elemental, than the political work for which she is so well known. In following the life of this young, unnamed woman writer as it intersects with those of a famous writer named Rostum, his wife Carmen, and a poet called Miriam, El Saadawi gives us a deeply felt exploration of the nature of identity, of fame, of writing, and of freedom.</p><p><b>Nawal El Saadawi</b> is the author of <i>Woman at Point Zero, God Dies by the Nile,</i> and <i>The Hidden Face of Eve</i>, and nearly forty other works of fiction, non-fiction, drama, and memoir, which have been translated into more than thirty languages. For over four decades, she has been Egypt's most prominent feminist activist; she has survived prison, death threats, and the government shutdown of her Arab Women's Solidarity Association and magazines she edited. She lived in exile for a number of years, and taught at and received honorary degrees from universities and colleges all over the world.&#34;More than any other woman, El Saadawi has come to embody the trials of Arab feminism.&#34;</p><h2>Lectionary Story Bible- Year C: Year C</h2><p>Once again, author Ralph Milton brings his enormous talent as storyteller to the task of retelling biblical stories.

It&#39;s how a small enterprise expands without losing focus. It&#39;s how a brilliant new idea or plan developed by the few goes on to be adopted by the many. And, in hard times and tough situations, it&#39;s how pockets of smart new thinking overcome cultures of indifference or negativity. An organisation that doesn&#39;t know how to scale up what is best within it won&#39;t achieve long-term success. Bestselling author robert sutton and his stanford colleague huggy rao have devoted nearly a decade to uncovering what it takes to create and spread outstanding performance, and in scaling up excellence they share the fruits of their research. Drawing on case studies that range from silicon valley enterprises to non-profit organisations, they provide crucial insights into corporate cultures, both good and bad, and offer a road map for establishing and stimulating excellence. In the process, they show how to use &#39;premortems&#39; when making big decisions about change. They reveal why seven is so often the magic number when it comes to team size. They examine successful and unsuccessful quests for improvement - in hospitals, schools and elsewhere. And they discuss when a single corporate mindset is best (&#39;catholicism&#39;) and when local variation is preferable (&#39;buddhism&#39;). Scaling up excellence is the first management book devoted to what is - or should be - a core priority for every organisation. As such it is destined to become the standard bearer.</p><p><p><b>Author One-on-One: Robert Suttonand Huggy Rao talk about <i>Scaling Up Excellence</i></b></p> <p><strong>Robert Sutton: </strong>Why don&#x2019;t we start off with why we wrote this book?</p> <p><strong>Huggy Rao: </strong>We wanted to give the executives we teach and advise better answers. In 2006, we launched an executive education program at Stanford called Customer-focused Innovation. Executives in the program kept asking us different versions of the same question. Their companies all had a pocket or two where people were customer focused. The problem was that there just wasn&#x2019;t enough of it. They asked how they could spread such excellence and do it fast. We scoured academic research and practical books on leaders and teams. We found a lot on topics such as leadership and innovation. But we couldn&#x2019;t find a single business book devoted to this problem, which we started calling &#x201c;the problem of more&#x201d; or the challenge of &#x201c;scaling up excellence.&#x201d;</p> <p>We spent the next seven years studying and writing about it. I believe that this is the first major business or leadership book on scaling. We worked hard to write an approachable and useful book, but also one that digs into this vexing challenge in some depth. We offer much hard won advice, but no instant and easy cures.</p> <p>Bob, why don&#x2019;t you tell people about our research? It was quite an adventure.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>We started by doing interviews and case studies, and digging up the most rigorous studies we could find on scaling. But we also wanted to reach out to people who were in the thick of scaling challenges. So we checked repeatedly with senior leaders such as Kaiser Permanente&#x2019;s Louise Liang (who led a successful information technology rollout in the largest U.S. private healthcare system), Facebook executive&#x2019;s Chris Cox and Mike Schroepfer (who grew the engineering organization), and JetBlue Airlines pilot and executive Bonny Simi (who led a bottom-up effort to create and scale up a better system for dealing with operational challenges caused by bad weather). We wanted to make sure that the challenges we discussed, the stories we told, and advice we offered rang true to these and hundreds of other scaling up veterans we talked to during those seven years.</p> <p><strong>HR: </strong>What do you say when people ask you &#x201c;what do you mean by scaling?&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>I tell them that we fixed our focus on a simple, but tough, question: If your organization has a bit of excellence, a pocket of goodness, how do you spread it? Early on in the project, I saw an interview with the famous folk singer Pete Seeger. He said something like &#x201c;Sometimes the only thing wrong with it is there isn&#x2019;t enough of it.&#x201d; A lovely way to describe the main problem we tackled. </p> <p><strong>HR: </strong>I was struck by how similar the scaling challenges were that different organizations faced. The challenges of growing Google, of opening 180 highly standardized Bridge International Academy schools for poor children in Africa, and spreading practices for preventing infections to over 3000 hospitals sound quite different on first blush. But they turned out to be remarkably similar in many ways once we looked closely.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>How so?</p> <p><strong>HR: </strong>In every case, successful scaling didn&#x2019;t mean just creating as big a footprint as possible, as fast possible &#x2013; it required spreading a shared mindset that guided how people thought and acted. We learned that, especially in cases of fast and effective scaling, the teams that guided these efforts often slowed down at key junctures &#x2013; to think about what they are doing and to develop true excellence &#x2013; so they could move faster later. Scaling takes both patience and persistence, in concert with an obsessive focus on making progress toward long term goals every hour of every day.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>We also learned that the key decisions and scaling principles were remarkably similar across different kinds of organizations. For example every organization and project gets more complex as it expands. More processes, layers, locations, and people are required. As a result, scaling nearly always adds &#x201c;cognitive load&#x201d; -- increased demands -- on people and teams. If it is not dealt with well, people feel overwhelmed. It becomes hard to get simple things done. In the best organizations, to paraphrase Twitter&#x2019;s head of engineering Chris Fry, leaders use the hierarchy to destroy bad bureaucracy -- to make things easier rather than harder for people. Fry&#x2019;s advice holds in every scaling case we studied. </p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>Let&#x2019;s end with the question that EVERYONE asks me about you. Is your name really Huggy?</p> <p><strong>HR: </strong>My real name is Hayagreeva, but my family and friends have always called me Huggy. I thought &#x201c;Huggy&#x201d; would be easier for people to pronounce and remember.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong> It&#x2019;s been quite a collaboration. Huggy was relentlessly optimistic during even the toughest days. Huggy is among the smartest and most imaginative organizational researchers on the planet. The rate at which he generates ideas astounds me. One minute he might be talking about &#x201c;linking hot causes to cool solution,&#x201d; the next &#x201c;scaling is about going from bad to great, not so much good to great.&#x201d; </p> <p>We worked with so many terrific people facing scaling challenges, from entrepreneurs and startups, to senior executives at big corporations, to leaders and teams in nonprofits and large healthcare systems. But we stayed focused on one goal: Writing a book would ring true and be useful to anyone who strives to develop excellence in organizations and spreading it to others.</p>ROBERT I.

Twombly's early contacts with both the modern European tradition and New York School painting are examined, and the emergence of his own distinct style in the mid-1950s is presented with a new clarity.<br>More than fifty of the artist's most important paintings from all phases of his career are reproduced in color, including recent works never seen outside the studio and several important earlier works not previously published. A dozen sculptures, stretching from the artist's early assemblages of the 1940s through work of recent years, are also reproduced, as well as more than forty works on paper.</p><p>Twombly, an American artist who has lived in Italy for most of his professional life, has ridden out both the storms and the doldrums of critical reception and rejection in his native country. Now, as part of a major retrospective held at the Museum of Modern Art, the most comprehensive monograph yet on Twombly and his work has been published, and it will do much to secure his place in the annals of American art. Painting with purpose by the time he was 12, Twombly attended Black Mountain College with such peers as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns but ended up making work far more elusive and puzzling than their radical but graspable creations. Twombly never made figurative or pop images but, rather, developed an energetically linear and most often monochromatic visual vocabulary. Varnedoe carefully and astutely identifies Twombly's influences, which include primitive as well as classical art, but, for the most part, Twombly's paintings and drawings seem primarily to mirror the nervousness and obsession of thought and rumination. Twombly's work is all about light and movement, concealment and erasure, the passage of time, and the urge to record the flicker and flash of emotion, memory, and dream. <i>Donna Seaman</i>This catalog, published in conjunction with the major retrospective of Twombly's career at the Museum of Modern Art, provides context for the re-evaluation of the artist's long career. Curator Varnedoe traces Twombly's early career in Virginia, his studies in Boston and New York and at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, and his eventual move to Italy. Twombly's canvases are at times both hieratic and childlike; the numerous color and black-and-white illustrations complement Varnedoe's at times enigmatic commentary, which cuold have provided more interpretation. Varnedoe will not convert unbelievers in Twombly's work. Recommended for larger collections of art or for those who do not invest in the ongoing catalogue raisonne series prepared by Heiner Bastian (Cy Twombly: Catalogue Raisonne of the Paintings, 1992+).<br><i>Martin R.

He still harasses her for the money she spent on tuition.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>BEING a skinny, blond lightweight, the first time I went to a bar, I had to sneak in illegally. It was a bar in the West Village, and I felt so cool&#x2014;as if I had pulled a prank on the entire universe. I got kicked out for making out loudly with a patron rather than being an utter drunk, so I guess I get a bonus point for being a flirt and not an alcoholic.</p><p>My intimate relationship with liquor began in the city, despite the fact that I was raised in the Garden State. I got to know some of the newest and best drinks by hanging in the <i>bright lights, big city</i>, but it wasn&#x2019;t until my stint at bartending school that I really learned the basics of the art heretofore known as mixology<i>.</i> As an actress and stand-up comic, I figured bartending would be a great way to make money at night and maybe even pick up a hot guy or two. My Jewish dad lovingly handed me the bread to pay for the class, but once I realized I might attract more loons behind the bar than I already did in front of the bar, I decided to keep my love for liquor a &#x201c;nonoccupational&#x201d; pursuit. Needless to say, my father was not too happy that his precious money had been squandered. To this day he still says, &#x201c;Remember when you took that bartending course? You never even worked a day behind the bar.&#x201d;</p><p>Thanks, Pops.</p><p>During the class, I applied my perky overachieving attitude to mixing drinks, just like I do with everything else in life.</p><p>&#x201c;The drink has to be perfect. How do I know exactly how much to use?&#x201d; I asked my instructor, a handsome dark-skinned hipster who wasn&#x2019;t even trying to be a hipster.</p><p>He pushed his dark Buddy Holly glasses back up his nose and said, &#x201c;There are no concrete rules in love&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or alcohol. Just play around until it tastes right. Put your Type-A attitude aside.&#x201d;</p><p>I was skeptical of his laissez-faire outlook, but I went with it, and so far, no one&#x2019;s been hurt. And that&#x2019;s just the point of this book. Except, perhaps, for hard-core bartending jobs at pricey restaurants, mixology is at best an inexact science. If it had to be precise, very few people would drink, and the world would be a miserable place (and perhaps less populated). There are always going to be differences in the way two people mix the same drink. Some go heavy on the alcohol, some go light. Some change the ingredients, some change the proportions. Lots of ice versus one or two cubes. You say old-fashioned, I say lowball. The goal is to make a drink that tastes good to you&#x2014;and to your guests.</p><p>Get intimate with your liquor supply. Experiment with what you have using the recipes in this book, or try something new. The recipes&#x2014;some new, some old, some adapted for today&#x2019;s tastes&#x2014;are mere guidelines. The step-by-step instructions are intended to make mixing a drink as easy as possible for you.</p><p>Because all drink and no play makes for a very unintelligible and dull boy or girl, I&#x2019;ve filled this book with party-planning tips and ideas for creating the perfect home bar: the drinks, the ambience, and the attitude that will enable you to be a master mixologist and the perfect host.</p><p>And don&#x2019;t forget: Try not to overindulge. While I love a good party as much as the next gal, I&#x2019;m more concerned about your health, your personal welfare, and the well-being of your friends. Don&#x2019;t let your friends drink and drive. And if health is your main concern when it comes to libations, never fear. In the age of Zumba and the juice cleanse, plenty of folks are drinking more moderately in the interest of fitness. This book<i> </i>offers plenty of ideas for lighter and nonalcoholic drinks that won&#x2019;t make you regain the freshman fifteen.</p><p>Bartending can be lots of fun if you follow your instincts, do what you like, and provide your guests with a safe good time. Relax and enjoy yourself, and you&#x2019;ll always be the life of the party.</p><p>Cheers!</p><p></p><p></p><p>STOCKING YOUR BAR</p><p>THE home bar should reflect your personal taste and reveal a little about what makes you you. Not everyone needs to stock every exotic liquor on the market just to impress a few visitors. If all you and your friends ever drink is beer, wine and straight vodka, well then, there&#x2019;s your shopping list, my friend. But home bars can grow. Maybe you&#x2019;ll start out with three items and gradually add a few different liquors and a flavorful liqueur or two. Then one day you&#x2019;ll be browsing in a liquor store and you&#x2019;ll pick up a small bottle of whatever it is you&#x2019;ve been meaning to try&#x2014;and so grows your home bar.</p><p>Your initial purchases, then, should be based on what you&#x2019;ll use most and what you and your friends and family like. If you know what you want, you&#x2019;re better off buying in large quantities, since larger bottles are generally less expensive per unit than smaller bottles. But there&#x2019;s no need to go overboard when making your initial purchases; buy reasonable amounts, unless, of course, you are sure that you like something in particular. Then, by all means buy as much as you want, especially if you find it for a good price.</p><p>While every bar will be slightly different, here are some basic guidelines. Outlined below is a suggested shopping list for a starter bar. Make any adjustments you like.</p><p>The Basic Home Bar Checklist</p><p>LIQUORS</p><p>1 bottle bourbon (750 ml)</p><p>1 bottle brandy (750 ml)</p><p>1 bottle Canadian whiskey (750 ml)</p><p>1 bottle dry gin (1� liters)</p><p>1 bottle rum (1� liters)</p><p>1 bottle Scotch whiskey (750 ml)</p><p>1 bottle tequila (1� liters)</p><p>1 bottle vodka (1� liters)</p><p>LIQUEURS</p><p>small bottles of the following:</p><p>triple sec</p><p>amaretto</p><p>cr�me de menthe</p><p>Drambuie</p><p>cr�me de cacao</p><p>B�n�dictine</p><p>Kahl�a</p><p>Cointreau</p><p>WINE AND BEER</p><p>1 bottle dry vermouth (small)</p><p>1 bottle sweet vermouth (small)</p><p>2 six-packs beer (1 regular, 1 light)</p><p>2 bottles white wine</p><p>2 bottles red wine</p><p>1 bottle ros� wine (optional)</p><p>1 bottle champagne or sparkling wine</p><p>The Home Bar of Champions</p><p>If the basic stocking suggestions don&#x2019;t appeal to you, perhaps you&#x2019;re looking for liquors that make a bolder statement. Well, take a look below. The spirits mentioned here are more daring&#x2014;they go beyond the ordinary bartender&#x2019;s collection, allowing you to be a mixologist&#x2019;s mixologist. But you needn&#x2019;t invest in the entire list right off the bat. Go slowly. Find out what you like by tasting, whether at friends&#x2019; homes or when you go out for a drink.</p><p>And if you like a drink you taste when you&#x2019;re out, ask the friendly bartender for his or her number&#x2014;for the drink recipe, I mean.</p><p>LIQUOR</p><p>1 bottle brandy</p><p>1 bottle V.S.O.P. cognac</p><p>1 bottle dry English gin</p><p>1 bottle Irish whiskey</p><p>1 bottle dark rum (Jamaican)</p><p>1 bottle gold rum</p><p>1 bottle light rum</p><p>1 bottle blended Scotch whiskey</p><p>1 bottle Tennessee whiskey</p><p>1 bottle gold tequila</p><p>1 bottle white tequila</p><p>1 or 2 bottles premium vodka (Russian or Scandinavian; store in your freezer)</p><p>LIQUEURS</p><p>small bottles of the following:</p><p>framboise, kirschwasser, plum brandy (slivovitz) or other flavored brandies of your choice</p><p>cr�me de cassis, sambuca, Galliano, Frangelico, Kahl�a, peppermint schnapps, peach schnapps or any other of your favorite liqueurs, approximately five bottles in all</p><p>WINE</p><p>3 aperitif wines, such as Dubonnet, Lillet, Campari</p><p>1 bottle cream sherry</p><p>1 bottle port</p><p>1 bottle madeira</p><p>several bottles of your favorite white wines, including at least one table wine and one dessert wine</p><p>several bottles of your favorite red wines, ranging from dry to sweet</p><p>2 or 3 bottles champagne and/or sparkling wine</p><p>Mixers</p><p>Whether you stock a basic bar or one with all the extras, you will need to keep on hand a supply of the following:</p><p>Bloody Mary mix</p><p>club soda</p><p>coffee</p><p>cola</p><p>cranberry juice cocktail</p><p>cream (heavy and light)</p><p>cream of coconut</p><p>Falernum</p><p>ginger ale</p><p>grapefruit juice</p><p>grenadine</p><p>lemon juice</p><p>lime juice (Rose&#x2019;s is the most popular&#x2014;it is not a substitute for fresh lime juice, however, since it contains a sugary syrup)</p><p>orange juice</p><p>orgeat (almond syrup)</p><p>passion fruit juice (or nectar)</p><p>pi�a colada mix</p><p>pineapple juice</p><p>seltzer</p><p>lemon-lime soda (such as Sprite or 7-Up)</p><p>sour mix</p><p>tomato juice</p><p>tonic water</p><p>water (distilled or spring)</p><p>Odds and Ends</p><p>No bar would be complete without the miscellaneous ingredients and garnishes that make mixed drinks truly special.

A description of the various types of glassware follows.</p><p><b>balloon</b> (large wineglass) Ranges in size from 9 to 14 ounces.</p><p><b>beer goblet</b> A stemmed balloon-type glass that holds about 12 ounces.</p><p><b>beer mug</b> 12 to 16 ounces.</p><p><b>brandy snifter</b> Best to choose those that hold 3, 6 or 12 ounces. They do come larger, though. For straight brandy.</p><p><b>champagne flute</b> For champagne, champagne drinks or wine. Holds 4 to 6 ounces.</p><p><b>champagne saucer</b> Also for champagne, but this type allows bubbles to escape more readily than the fluted or tulip type. Holds about 4 ounces.</p><p><b>champagne tulip</b> For champagne, champagne drinks or wine. Holds 4 to 6 ounces.</p><p><b>cocktail</b> This is your basic glass for drinks &#x201c;straight up.&#x201d; Ranges in size from 3 ounces to 6 ounces. The large ones can be used for frozen drinks. The 4�-ounce size can be used for martinis, Manhattans and stingers. Sturdy, solid stems are best since you can hold on to the stem without warming the drink.</p><p><b>Collins</b> Ranges in size from 10 to 14 ounces. Used for Collins drinks, fizzes, exotic drinks like Mai Tais, Singapore Slings, relatives of Long Island Ice Teas and other mixed drinks that require a bit more room than a highball. Some Collins glasses are frosted for effect.</p><p><b>double rocks</b> Holds 14 to 16 ounces. For larger drinks &#x201c;on the rocks.&#x201d; A gaining trend on the glassware scene.</p><p><b>goblet</b> Approximately 12 ounces. Great for tropical drinks, blended drinks, frozen drinks. The 22-ounce hurricane glass can also be used for really mammoth drinks.</p><p><b>highball</b> Ranges in size from 8 to 12 ounces. Good for most standard mixed drinks. Similar to a Collins glass, but shorter and wider.</p><p><b>martini</b> Similar to a cocktail glass, but with a distinctive V shape. Nothing beats a martini in an actual martini glass. About 4 ounces.</p><p><b>hot drink mug</b> 10 to 12 ounces. Used for hot drinks, hot coffee drinks, cappuccinos, Irish coffee, etc.</p><p><b>parfait</b> A specialty glass, approximately 7� ounces; can be used for drinks containing ice cream and/or fruit.</p><p><b>pilsner</b> 10 to 16 ounces. Used for beer.</p><p><b>pony (cordial)</b> Up to 2 ounces. Can be used for liqueurs, brandy and small pousse-caf�s.</p><p><b>pousse-caf�</b> A specialty glass for drinks that are &#x201c;floated,&#x201d; such as Rainbow Pousse-Caf� or Traffic Light.</p><p><b>red wine</b> Holds 6 to 11 ounces. Is more rounded than a white wine glass, in order to direct the bouquet of red wine to the drinker&#x2019;s nose.</p><p><b>rocks</b> (stemmed or not stemmed) Ranges in size from 6 to 8 ounces. Also called &#x201c;lowball&#x201d; or &#x201c;old-fashioned.&#x201d; Used for drinks served &#x201c;on the rocks.&#x201d; If you don&#x2019;t own shot glasses, you can use these to serve straight shots of liquor or liqueur.</p><p><b>sherry</b> Holds about 3 ounces. Used for cordials and liqueurs. You can substitute the popular Spanish <i>copita.</i></p><p><b>shot</b> Ranges from a fraction of an ounce to 2 ounces (long shot). The standard shot measure these days is 1� ounces (also called a jigger). Can hold one liquor or can be used for mixed shooters. It also comes in a two-sided metal measuring version, where one side holds 1 ounce and the other side holds 1� ounces.</p><p><b>sour</b> Also called a delmonico glass or a whiskey sour glass. Holds 5 or 6 ounces. Known for its use with sours of all kinds.</p><p><b>white wine</b> Can also hold from 6 to 11 ounces, although generally a bit smaller than red wine glasses.</p><p></p><p></p><p>MEASURE FOR MEASURE</p><p>SOMEHOW, the ways alcoholic beverages are measured, in both the bottle and the mixing glass, have always managed to confuse most people. Just what <i>is</i> a fifth? Which holds more&#x2014;a pony or a jigger? The charts below should help clear things up.</p><p>Bottle Sizes</p><p>Remember when you rolled your eyes in math class, wondering why you should bother learning the metric system? Well, your teachers must have known something, because on December 31, 1979, the sizing of liquor bottles in America was converted to metrics. I always knew I should have been nicer to my math teacher!</p><p>Spirits</p><p>Wines</p><p>Standard Bar Measurements</p><p>No, bar measurements don&#x2019;t have anything to do with metrics, but they are confusing enough nonetheless. Keep this chart handy, though, and you&#x2019;ll do all right.</p><p></p><p></p><p>GARNISHES</p><p>GARNISHES can add flavor or flair to any drink. Here are the garnishes you&#x2019;ll encounter most often, plus a few special ones.</p><p>Types of Garnishes</p><p><b>bitters</b> The leading name in bitters is Angostura, but orange bitters are sometimes called for instead.</p><p><b>celery</b> A Bloody Mary would be incomplete without celery. And, hey, it makes the drink healthy&#x2014;right?</p><p><b>cherries</b> Maraschino cherries are most often used. They usually are red, but green ones exist, too. Maraschino cherries make great garnishes for tropical drinks and many sours, as well as the standard Manhatta...</p></p><h2>Milking the Moon: A Southerner&#39;s Story of Life on This Planet</h2><p>A vivid oral biography of the late Eugene Walter describes his Southern roots and its influence on his life, his journey to Greenwich Village in the late-1940s, experiences in 1950s Parisian expatriate cafe society and 1960s Rome, and his encounters with such luminaries as William Faulkner, Martha Graham, Judy Garland, and Marcello Mastroianni. Reprint. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>When Katherine Clark began interviewing Eugene Walter (1921-98) in 1991 for an oral biography of this Mobile, Alabama, legend's picaresque life, friends asked her, "Do you think he will tell you the truth?" "I certainly hope not!" she replied. Clark, herself a Southerner, understood that the charm of Walter's conversation came from his brilliantly polished stories, in which "at a certain point the actual gives way to the apocryphal." So readers shouldn't ask if Tallulah Bankhead really gave Walter three pubic hairs or if Anna Magnani actually asked the mayor of Rome to help find Walter's lost cat: that's not the point. These anecdotes express Walter's appreciation of people he likes, and although the narrative is stuffed with famous names from Truman Capote to Leontyne Price, the exuberant protagonist finds less celebrated folks just as fascinating. His loving evocation of Mobile in the 1920s, when the front porch was the center of all social life, is just as detailed as his portraits of sojourns in more glamorous enclaves: Greenwich Village after World War II ("where I could sit in the evenings and hear Jane and Paul Bowles quarreling in their nearby apartment"); Paris in the early 1950s (his short story "Troubador" appeared in the first issue of <i>Paris Review</i>); and Rome during its <i>La Dolce Vita</i> years. Walter refused Fellini's plea that he perform with his marionettes in that particular movie, but he played an American journalist in <i>8 1/2</i> and "must have been in over a hundred of those crazy Italian films" before returning to Mobile in 1979. ("Sooner or later all Southerners come home, not to die, but to eat gumbo.") Clark, who captured an Alabama midwife's wisdom in <i>Motherwit</i>, gets out of her subject's way and lets his words create an enchanting world in this marvelously entertaining reminiscence. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>&#x201c;Amazing...We owe Katherine Clark an incalculable debt. ...Not since John Kennedy Toole&#x2019;s <b>A Confederacy of Dunces</b> has a book come from so completely out of the blue to give me so much pleasure.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jonathan Yardley, <i>Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;Katherine Clark . . . has edited Eugene Walter&#x2019;s oral history into a book as amazing as the man himself.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jonathan Yardley, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Milking the Moon</b> has perfect pitch and flawlessly captures Eugene&#x2019;s pixilated wonderland of a life. . . .

She's been nominated six times for an Academy Award, winning the Best Actress Oscar in 1974 for <i>Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore</i>, as well as a Tony for her performance in Same Time, Next Year. She continues to serve as copresident of the Actors Studio in New York City.In her first book, Oscar- and Tony-winning actress Burstyn has cast a life story that could easily light up the silver screen, replete with abusive parents, high school tragedy, showbiz triumph, reversals of fortune and a plucky heroine in search of professional and spiritual fulfillment. Burstyn begins with impressionistic memories of her Detroit childhood, including her tumultuous relationship with her mother and stepfather Lou, moving from the scare of her brother's near-fatal struggle with pneumonia when she was not yet 3 to the traumatic illegal abortion she had at age 18. Burstyn's career kicks off a few years later on Broadway, launching her on a challenging path to movie stardom, a number of failed romances-including a mentally ill husband who would stalk her for years-and her globe-spanning search for religion. Burstyn's tell-all works beautifully, thanks to her talent for spare but clear description; the happy story of Stone House, her home in upstate New York for 11 years, covers just a few pages, but Burstyn still makes her farewell to the house resonate: "I walked away with a sense of carrying my own chapel with me." The blemish in this upbeat, chatty book is Burstyn's occasional tendency toward self-help language-"The more I struggled to free myself, the more entangled I became"-but it's easy to forgive, given the honesty, bravery and warmth with which she tells her story.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His newest book, <i>Valiant Ambition: George Washington, Benedict Arnold, and the Fate of the American Revolution</i>, will be published in May 2016.<b>Preface: The Decisive Day</b><br><br>On a hot, almost windless afternoon in June, a seven-year-old boy stood beside his mother and looked out across the green islands of Boston Harbor. To the northwest, sheets of fire and smoke rose from the base of a distant hill. Even though the fighting was at least ten miles away, the concussion of the great guns burst like bubbles across his tear-streaked face.<br><br>At that moment, John Adams, the boy&#x2019;s father, was more than three hundred miles to the south at the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Years later, the elder Adams claimed that the American Revolution had started not with the Boston Massacre, or the Tea Party, or the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord and all the rest, but had been &#x201c;effected before the war commenced . . . in the minds and hearts of the people.&#x201d; For his son, however, the &#x201c;decisive day&#x201d; (a phrase used by the boy&#x2019;s mother, Abigail) was June 17, 1775.<br><br>Seventy-one years after that day, in the jittery script of an old man, John Quincy Adams described the terrifying afternoon when he and his mother watched the battle from a hill beside their home in Braintree: &#x201c;I saw with my own eyes those fires, and heard Britannia&#x2019;s thunders in the Battle of Bunker&#x2019;s hill and witnessed the tears of my mother and mingled with them my own.&#x201d; They feared, he recounted, that the British troops might at any moment march out of Boston and &#x201c;butcher them in cold blood&#x201d; or take them as hostages and drag them back into the besieged city. But what he remembered most about the battle was the hopeless sense of sorrow that he and his mother felt when they learned that their family physician, Dr. Joseph Warren, had been killed.<br><br>Warren had saved John Quincy Adams&#x2019;s badly fractured forefinger from amputation, and the death of this &#x201c;beloved physician&#x201d; was a terrible blow to a boy whose father&#x2019;s mounting responsibilities required that he spend months away from home. Even after John Quincy Adams had grown into adulthood and become a public figure, he refused to attend all anniversary celebrations of the Battle of Bunker Hill. Joseph Warren, just thirty-four at the time of his death, had been much more than a beloved doctor to a seven-year-old boy. Over the course of the two critical months between the outbreak of hostilities at Lexington Green and the Battle of Bunker Hill, he became the most influential patriot leader in the province of Massachusetts. As a member of the Committee of Safety, he had been the man who ordered Paul Revere to alert the countryside that British soldiers were headed to Concord; as president of the Provincial Congress, he had overseen the creation of an army even as he waged a propaganda campaign to convince both the American and British people that Massachusetts was fighting for its survival in a purely defensive war. While his more famous compatriots John Adams, John Hancock, and Samuel Adams were in Philadelphia at the Second Continental Congress, Warren was orchestrating the on-the-ground reality of a revolution.<br><br>Warren had only recently emerged from the shadow of his mentor Samuel Adams when he found himself at the head of the revolutionary movement in Massachusetts, but his presence (and absence) were immediately felt. When George Washington assumed command of the provincial army gathered outside Boston just two and a half weeks after the Battle of Bunker Hill, he was forced to contend with the confusion and despair that followed Warren&#x2019;s death. Washington&#x2019;s ability to gain the confidence of a suspicious, stubborn, and parochial assemblage of New England militiamen marked the advent of a very different kind of leadership. Warren had passionately, often impulsively, tried to control the accelerating cataclysm. Washington would need to master the situation deliberately and&#x2014;above all&#x2014;firmly. Thus, the Battle of Bunker Hill is the critical turning point in the story of how a rebellion born in the streets of Boston became a countrywide war for independence.<br><br>This is also the story of two British generals. The first, Thomas Gage, was saddled with the impossible task of implementing his government&#x2019;s unnecessarily punitive response to the Boston Tea Party in December 1773. Gage had a scrupulous respect for the law and was therefore ill equipped to subdue a people who were perfectly willing to take that law into their own hands. When fighting broke out at Lexington and Concord, militiamen from across the region descended upon the British stationed at Boston. Armed New Englanders soon cut off the land approaches to Boston. Ironically, the former center of American resistance found itself gripped by an American siege. By the time General William Howe replaced Gage as the British commander in chief, he had determined that New York, not Boston, was where he must resume the fight. It was left to Washington to hasten the departure of Howe and his army. The evacuation of the British in March 1776 signaled the beginning of an eight-year war that produced a new nation. But it also marked the end of an era that had started back in 1630 with the founding of the Puritan settlement called Boston. This is the story of how a revolution changed that 146-year-old community&#x2014;of what was lost and what was gained when 150 vessels filled with British soldiers and American loyalists sailed from Boston Harbor for the last time.<br><br>Over the more than two centuries since the Revolution, Boston has undergone immense physical change. Most of the city&#x2019;s once-defining hills have been erased from the landscape while the marshes and mudflats that surrounded Boston have been filled in to eliminate almost all traces of the original waterfront. But hints of the vanished town remain. Several meetinghouses and churches from the colonial era are still standing, along with a smattering of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century houses. Looking southeast from the balcony of the Old State House, you can see how the spine of what was once called King Street connects this historic seat of government, originally known as the Town House, to Long Wharf, an equally historic commercial center that still reaches out into the harbor.<br><br>For the last three years I have been exploring these places, trying to get a fix on the long-lost topography that is essential to understanding how Boston&#x2019;s former residents interacted. Boston in the 1770s was a land-connected island with a population of about fifteen thousand, all of whom probably recognized, if not knew, each other. Being myself a resident of an island with a year-round population very close in size to provincial Boston&#x2019;s, I have some familiarity with how petty feuds, family alliances, professional jealousies, and bonds of friendship can transform a local controversy into a supercharged outpouring of communal angst. The issues are real enough, but why we find ourselves on one side or the other of those issues is often unclear even to us. Things just happen in a way that has little to do with logic or rationality and everything to do with the mysterious and infinitely complex ways that human beings respond to one another.<br><br>In the beginning there were three different colonial groups in Massachusetts. One group was aligned with those who eventually became revolutionaries. For lack of a better word, I will call these people &#x201c;patriots.&#x201d; Another group remained faithful to the crown, and they appear herein as &#x201c;loyalists.&#x201d; Those in the third and perhaps largest group were not sure where they stood. Part of what makes a revolution such a fascinating subject to study is the arrival of the moment when neutrality is no longer an option. Like it or not, a person has to choose.<br><br>It was not a simple case of picking right from wrong. Hindsight has shown that, contrary to what the patriots insisted, Britain had not launched a preconceived effort to enslave her colonies. Compared with other outposts of empire, the American colonists were exceedingly well off. It&#x2019;s been estimated that they were some of the most prosperous, least-taxed people in the Western world. And yet there was more to the patriots&#x2019; overheated claims about oppression than the eighteenth-century equivalent of a conspiracy theory. The hyperbole and hysteria that so mystified the loyalists had wellsprings that were both ancient and strikingly immediate. For patriots and loyalists alike, this was personal.<br><br>Because a revolution gave birth to our nation, Americans have a tendency to exalt the concept of a popular uprising. We want the whole world to be caught in a blaze of liberating upheaval (with appropriately democratic results) because that was what worked so well for us. If Gene Sharp&#x2019;s From Dictatorship to Democracy, the guidebook that has become a kind of bible among twenty-first- century revolutionaries in the Middle East and beyond, is any indication, the mechanics of overthrowing a regime are essentially the same today as they were in the eighteenth century. And yet, given our tendency to focus on the Founding Fathers who were at the Continental Congress in Philadelphia when all of this was unfolding in and around Boston, most of us know surprisingly little about how the patriots of Massachusetts pulled it off.<br><br>In the pages that follow, I hope to provide an intimate account of how over the course of just eighteen months a revolution transformed a city and the towns that surrounded it, and how that transformation influenced what eventually became the Unites States of America. This is the story of two charismatic and forceful leaders (one from Massachusetts, the other from Virginia), but it is also the story of two ministers (one a subtle, even Machiavellian, patriot, the other a punster and a loyalist); of a poet, patriot, and caregiver to four orphaned children; of a wealthy merchant who wanted to be everybody&#x2019;s friend; of a conniving traitor whose girlfriend betrayed him; of a sea captain from Marblehead who became America&#x2019;s first naval hero; of a bookseller with a permanently mangled hand who after a 300-mile trek through the wilderness helped to force the evacuation of the British; and of many others. In the end, the city of Boston is the true hero of this story. Whether its inhabitants came to view the Revolution as an opportunity or as a catastrophe, they all found themselves in the midst of a survival tale when on December 16, 1773, three shiploads of tea were dumped in Boston Harbor.</p><h2>Pork Chop Hill</h2><p>A firsthand account of frontline combat during the Korean War chronicles the courageous valor of a handful of U.S. riflemen, who held their posts on Pork Chop Hill against overwhelming odds.

S.G.B. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Thunderbolts of the Gods</h2><p>Thunderbolts of the Gods introduces the reader to a former age of planetary instability and earthshaking electrical events, and offers a revolutionary synthesis of historical investigation and the newly discovered Electric Universe. Solar system cosmic upheaval occurred so recently as to have profoundly affected early human cultures, provoking incomprehensible myths, symbols, and commemorative practices. Through a synthesis of ancient testimony, high-energy plasma experiments, and space age discoveries, the authors bring the ancient world to life. If their hypothesis is correct, it will surely alter many paths of scientific investigation as well. The little-known study of powerful electrical discharges in plasma is a new and exciting development in plasma cosmology , with profound implication for space age astronomy. To advance their case, the authors present side-by-side comparisons of laboratory plasma experiments and globally recurring symbols of the ancient sky. The evidence, they report, shows an ancient obsession with extremely violent electrical discharge formations in the heavens.</p><p>Raised in Portland, Oregon, David Talbott majored in education and political science and founded two statewide organizations aimed at upgrading the quality of education at secondary and higher education levels. From 1972 to 1975, he published a ten-issue journal, Immanuel Velikovsky Reconsidered, provoking renewed international interest in the work of the pioneering theorist. A few years later, following a lead provided by Velikovsky himself, he completed a book he called a reconstruction of the ancient sky. The Saturn Myth was published by Doubleday in 1980, and his original research provided a foundation for the independent investigations of several other scholars and scientists in the years to follow. Born and schooled in Melbourne, Australia, Wallace Thornhill completed a science degree at Melbourne University, majoring in physics and electronics. Careers in Melbourne, Canberra, and England have taken him from meteorology to IBM and the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra. He was persuaded that the celestial dramas Talbott had proposed were plasma discharge phenomena. The two reconnected in 1994 and 1997 at international conferences in Portland, Oregon, and this began a partnership devoted to a new vision of the universe and of planetary history.In Thunderbolts of the Gods Talbott and Thornhill have combined their knowledge and expertise to present solid evidence for a revised view of Earth s history. Their work reveals that the tales, artifacts, customs and petroglyphs of the ancients that have come down to us through the fog of time tell a mutually consistent and powerful single story. Our planet s past has been filled with cataclysmic events some of which were witnessed by our early ancestors. At first, modern scientists claimed these events were physically impossible. But now it is becoming clear that not only the geological record provides strong evidence for these cataclysms, but the emerging study of plasma cosmology also demonstrates how these events could have indeed occurred. Only a few books rise to the level of importance whereby we can say This book truly changed my view of history . In my opinion this is such a book because once you have read it you will never look at art, ancient literature, mythology, opera, history, archeology, anthropology, or astronomy with the same eyes ever again. --Donald E. Scott, Ph.D., retired professor of electrical engineering and author of The Electric Sky<br><br>Mainstream astronomy holds that the Solar System has remained stable and essentially as we see it today for billions of years, cycling with regular, repeating motions that can be extrapolated backward to reliably reconstruct conditions in the remote past. The assumptions upon which this belief rests date back over three centuries to the times of Kepler, Newton, and Laplace, which see a cosmos consisting of electrically neutral bodies moving in a vacuum under the sole influence of gravity. Yet space is now known to be pervaded by electrical plasma, and there is strong evidence that the planets and other bodies carry electric charge. Charged objects immersed in plasma spontaneously form double-layer isolating sheaths around themselves that contain their fields and prevent mutual electrical interaction. For as long as planets move without their "magnetospheres" coming into contact, quiescent conditions like those that exist today will prevail, which are indeed accurately modeled by gravitation. But should some disturbance or instability occur that causes magnetospheres to intersect, the bodies involved will experience sudden complex forces immensely more powerful than gravity, accompanied by-if they are at different potentials-colossal electrical discharges between them. In Thunderbolts of the Gods, David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill present a compendium of evidence from diverse sources showing that not only have such events affected the Earth, but they have done so within the time of recorded human history! From as far apart as China, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Americas, peoples of ancient times have left records in their myths, legends, religions, and art forms, of skies vastly different from those we see today, alive with spectacles of light, violence, and seeming heavenly deities in conflict that not only battled each other but brought widespread death and devastation to Earth. --James P.

Segar's original <i>Popeye</i> (a.k.a. Thimble Theatre) comic strips begins with a foreword by <i>Beetle Bailey</i> creator Mort Walker, and continues with an introduction by noted film and cartooning critic Donald Phelps. This second volume features work from 1930 to 1932, and most notably includes the debut of Segar's second greatest character: J. Wellington Wimpy, which stands as a one-of-a-kind icon some 70 years after his creation - the most likeable lowdown cad ever to grace the comics page. <i>Popeye Volume 2</i> includes the stories: "Clint Gore" (continued from the cliffhanger last volume); "A One-Way Bank," in which Popeye opens a bank that allows withdrawals but no deposits; a long war story featuring King Blozo that begins with "The Great Rough-House War"; and "Skullyville," which wraps up the daily strips for this volume.</p><p><p><strong>E.C. Segar</strong> (1894-1938), creator of Popeye, is a member of the Will Eisner Awards Hall of Fame. He was born in Chester, IL in 1894 and passed away in his longtime home of Santa Monica, CA. The National Cartoonists Society created the Elzie Segar Award in his honor, which was awarded annually to a cartoonist who has made a unique and outstanding contribution to the profession.</p><p><strong>Mort Walker</strong> has had a guiding hand in nine syndicated comic strips since 1950 and has been drawing <em>Beetle Bailey</em> for almost 58 years - the longest run by any cartoonist on his original creation.</p>Looking back to an era when comics were mainly about being funny, this lovingly produced coffee-table volume in the Complete Popeye series reprints <i>Thimble Theatre</i> strips from 1930 to 1932, in both color and black and white. By this time, the original leading characters of Segar's troupe had become a supporting cast for the one-eyed, cantankerous sailor with an odd sense of chivalry, a love of spinach and a massive pair of fists. In this volume, Popeye and his sweetie, the gangly spinster, Olive Oyl, subdue western bad men and settle the war between Tonsylania and Nazilia, while enjoying their testy courtship. Readers won't find the two-page spreads and camera angles they're used to in modern comics, but a rich, colorful soap opera full of wonderful moments. They won't run into much pretentious social commentary, either, though the episode in which Olive's brother, Castor, and Popeye open a One-Way Bank to give away money to needy people may have felt especially relevant during the Great Depression. Mainly, Popeye just punches out any guy in his way, the more pompous and tough-looking the better. As he tells Olive, I yam what I yam an' tha's all I yam! Segar's wildly fertile imagination is more than enough. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the years following&#x2014;with the publication of <i>The Magus,</i> <i>The French Lieutenant&#x2019;s Woman</i>, <i>The Ebony Tower,</i> and his other critically acclaimed works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry&#x2014;Fowles took his place among the most innovative and important English novelists of our time. Now, with this first volume of his journals, which covers the years from 1949 to 1965, we see revealed not only the creative development of a great writer but also the deep connection between Fowles&#x2019;s autobiographical experience and his literary inspiration.<br><br>Commencing in Fowles&#x2019;s final year at Oxford, the journals in this volume chronicle the years he spent as a university lecturer in France; his experiences teaching school on the Greek island of Spetsai (which would inspire <i>The Magus</i>) and his love affair there with the married woman who would later become his first wife; and his return to England and his ongoing struggle to achieve literary success. It is an account of a life lived in total engagement with the world; although Fowles the novelist takes center stage, we see as well Fowles the nascent poet and critic, ornithologist and gardener, passionate naturalist and traveler, cinephile and collector of old books.<br><br>Soon after he fell in love with his first wife, Elizabeth, Fowles wrote in his journal, &#x201c;She has asked me not to write about her in here. But I could not not write, loving her as I do. . . . What else I betrayed, I could not betray this diary.&#x201d; It is that determined, unsparing honesty and forthrightness that imbues these journals with all the emotional power and narrative complexity of his novels.

No attempt here at method or speed. The housework drags on all day - cleaning, hoovering, dusting, making beds, sewing, washing-up and so on. No one ever sits down before suppertime. It is wrong, but the smallness of the rooms and the house is so noticeable now. The nursery stuffed full of things, always untidy; the dining-room dark and gloomy - only the lounge is tolerable, and one never lives there. The cloistered life with no one to talk to, no one to laugh with - here I am like a hermit, and quite unnatural. An absolute craving for new faces, new meetings, new places. I would tell them so much, but a curious obstinacy prevents this. Always an air of mulish hostility.<br><br>24 September<br><br>Two beautiful things. A big, spacious sunset sky - elegant and not ostentatious, but curiously in the east, to the west nothing but a bank of low, dark clouds. The end of a Spergularia in the microscope - like a minute green saturn.1 A tiny shining ball with a ring of gauzy skin around it. Also the sails of some Thames barges half-hidden by mist. A curious thing. About to throw a piece of screwed-up paper into the yellow jug which serves as waste-paper basket, I said to myself, 'As much chance as you have of being genius.' It fell into the jug without a murmur, a 20 to 1 chance, at the least.<br><br>Another day of silence, listening to other people's trivialities - a dreadful hour at night when all the completely banal information gained from a visit of relatives is repeated and reviewed. Two mathematical impossibilities I should like to see. One, a graph of the words spoken by me each day over a year - the rise and fall would be eye-opening. Near zero here, and normal everywhere else. Two, a count of words spoken by my mother and myself - David and Goliatha!<br><br>The visit by unknown relations is frightening, slightly, to the ego, and being. I feel awkward, not because I feel superior, but because I feel that they feel I am. Probably oversensitivity. But they are definitely not at home with me.<br><br>Trying to get at oneself is a continual unwrapping - each new skin decreases steadily in beauty and value after it is exposed. Always the seed of truth, the maximum fulfilment of self, appears to be just beneath the next layer. Plainly there is no end to this unwrapping, but the sensation is damping.<br><br>Being a poet, divining beauty, is like divining nature - a gift. It does not matter if one does not create. It is enough to have the poetic vision. To see the beauty hidden. As I did tonight, hearing someone whistle in the distance as I stood by an open window. I felt all kinds of moods of streets at night, of walking with loved women, of the dark blue and whiteness, and the strange, magical desertion of streets at night. I felt it all exactly in a moment, such a rush of impressions that they can hardly be seized. Algernon Blackwood: 'To feel like a poet is not to be a poet.'1 True, yet, poetry making is not necessarily the printing of words. It is a philosophical outlook, an epicureanism, a hedonism.<br><br>25 September<br><br>3 a.m. Beautifully played New Orleans jazz, with clarinet in low register, and very jazzy tuba and cornet.

Talk of the utmost banality, on prices of mattresses, on Mrs Ramsey's daughter who married a doctor in Montreal. A few comments are made on poetry. So hopeless to try and explain. They would never understand. No mention of art can ever be developed in case we are 'highbrow' - God, how I hate that word! No philosophy is mentioned, without Thomas Hardy and Darwin getting dragged in. It is la mere. Her attitude to conversation is one of complete alertness. I must break in, and I must say something - and in she breaks and says something, whether she has any knowledge, real opinion or not. It is with great difficulty that I can keep my oyster silence. But I must not hurt. With le pere, it is partly a defence; modernity is ignored, age is suspicious of invention.<br><br>I feel violent with 'hate' against this bloody town. Least violent, now, against the geographical situation (once I longed for Devon), most against the way of life, and then the people who allow it to sap all the beauty of life out of them. All my sympathy goes out to the boy who ran away to be a bullfighter. I'm sure he must have 'felt' the complete horror of this place. This town can have as much horror mentally for a sensitive person as a blitzed city may have, physically, for a turnip. It is the unsociability, the not-knowing-anyone, the having-no-colour, that kills. No interesting people to talk to, no sincere people, no unusual things to do.<br><br>Then there is 'niceness' as a standard of judgement - God, how I hate that word, too! - 'a nice girl', 'a nice road'. Nice = colourless, efficient, with nose glued to the middle path, with middle interests, dizzy with ordinariness. Ugh!<br><br>Oxford, 6 October<br><br>Reread some early poems. All bad. It is like seeing oneself in a film walk naked through a crowded street.<br><br>But then to feel oneself unfolding, like a flower.<br><br>7 October<br><br>Lunch with Guy Hardy and Basil Beeston and a serious Pole.1 In the Kemp. I cannot concentrate on those with whom I happen to be. Always there are more interesting people at the next table. Beautiful women to be watched. G and BB seem so set up in the world - they sit on a terrace by the sea and I drift past, watching them, jealous, unhappy. Yet I have the jewel. I may drift to even-more-to-be-coveted terraces, and land.<br><br>*<br><br>Immortality is a convention, a white elephant. A futility. There is no logic in planning for it. No enjoyment, no beauty can come out of it. All life should be designed to be contained within life. Within the closed circle. Outside the theatre, the bouquets won't be seen. The turnip who gains fame in his life, and lives, has an immense superiority over the poet who becomes famous after his death, and obscurely exists. Immortality is the gravestone of the spirit. What use is the gravestone?<br><br>5 November<br><br>Guy Fawkes night. A great crowd of people, vaguely contented at shaking off the discipline of the world as it is. The undergraduates form the largest part, for the most part just watching, with a few active spirits shouting, calling, singing, making speeches. A certain air of forcedness about all these crowds. Fireworks shooting up, and people exploding away from them when they land. The police and the proctors standing ineffectively. Buses moving slowly, cars being rocked and thumped. Many climb up the scaffolding around the Martyr's Memorial,1 then a vague move is made to the Taj Mahal restaurant where there is a man climbing up, men shouting, and a solid mass of people. Water out of the windows.<br><br>Basically one cannot help feeling contempt for all this canaille, noisily and offensively drunk yet not doing anything positive. Most of them posturing in a ridiculous manner. A good many girls, who seem the most genuinely excited.<br><br>To a certain extent there is a vast good will that can be sensed; roughly everyone is together and enjoying themselves, with the police and the proctors symbolizing all kinds of emotion and, ultimately, the determinism in life. GH and BB both enjoy themselves, and look for some means to manifest their lawlessness. I have absolutely no desire to do anything else but watch, wanting to be everywhere and see everything, observing people's faces. Roger Hendry2 is like me but not so finely 'set', for he has to pretend to a certain lawlessness which isn't innate in him at all.<br><br>Too many of the faces are vacuous and want filling.<br><br>The sight of the girl in green, about whom I wrote the Hospital story, with a thick well set-up young man, is distressing. Above all the sight of the moon, nearly full, in a clear night sky, not particularly cold, after a dull, rainy day. I wanted very much to see one of the people who climbed the Memorial fall down to his death. The indrawn breath and sudden laugh would have been most effective.<br><br>12 November<br><br>A self-searching night at the Podges1, with Faith.<br><br>Faith, a curious kind of extrovert, conversation-dominating, with the same strident rise in pitch (when she wishes to break in on top of anyone else) as M. Confidential, bold, tomboyish - revealing about her monastic father, whom she says worries her greatly at times.<br><br>Podge and Eileen are a perfect duo; in harmony or perfect discord.<br><br>During this evening (having felt ill all day, with a certain amount of pain) I keep very quiet and feel unable to assert myself in any way. Not particularly self-conscious and oversensitive but lacking more than lost colour. Two mes: ego, thinking with and at tangents from the others, full of the right words, curious ideas and so on; and the alter ego, not being able to break into the discussions.<br><br>An empty walk home with Faith, yawning myself and she whistling and singing.3 I feel a vague need to explain myself, and also to know what she is thinking. A wet, warm, windy night.<br><br>I can feel more concretely a philosophy of life on occasions like these. To be persuasive, to watch and analyse, externally; internally, to record and create.

But what&#x2019;s in the archives is staggering: a spymaster&#x2019;s trove missing since the end of the war, one that Gordon has always claimed is full of &#x201c;secrets you can&#x2019;t find anywhere else . . . <i>live</i> ammunition.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet key documents are still missing, and Nat believes Gordon has hidden them. The FBI agrees, and when Gordon is found dead in jail, the Bureau dispatches Nat to track down the material, which has also piqued the interest of several dangerous competitors. As he follows a trail of cryptic clues left behind by Gordon, assisted by an attractive academic with questionable motives, Nat&#x2019;s quest takes him to Bern and Berlin, where his path soon crosses that of Kurt Bauer, an aging German arms merchant still hoarding his own wartime secrets. As their stories&#x2014;and Gordon&#x2019;s&#x2014;intersect across half a century, long-buried exploits of deceit, devotion, and doomed resistance begin working their way to the surface. And as the stakes rise, so do the risks . . .</p><p>Dan Fesperman&#x2019;s travels as a writer have taken him to thirty countries and three war zones. <i>Lie in the Dark </i>won the Crime Writers&#x2019; Association of Britain&#x2019;s John Creasey Memorial Dagger Award for best first crime novel, <i>The Small Boat of Great Sorrows</i> won their Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award for best thriller, and <i>The Prisoner of Guant�namo </i>won the Dashiell Hammett Award from the International Association of Crime Writers. He lives in Baltimore.ONE <br><br>The biggest hazard of studying history,&#x201d; Nat Turnbull once told his wife, &#x201c;is that if you spend too much time looking backward, you&#x2019;ll be facing the wrong way when the forces of the here and now roll forward to crush you.&#x201d;<br><br>As if to prove the point, his wife filed for divorce the following week, catching Nat completely by surprise. Five years later he was again facing the wrong way, so to speak, when a pair of phone calls summoned him urgently back to the dangers of the present. He was three stories underground at the time, asleep at his desk in the stacks of the university library. An unlikely location, perhaps, for the beginning of an adventure in which lives would be lost, but Nat was trained to appreciate that sort of irony.<br><br>The first call arrived just as a dark dream of another era goose-stepped across his brain. His cell phone jolted him awake, squirming in his pocket like a frog. Opening his eyes to utter darkness, Nat realized he must have slept past closing hour. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time. He kept a flashlight for these emergencies, but it seemed to have disappeared. No use groping for the lamp, either. Security would have cut the power by now. Library budgets weren&#x2019;t what they used to be at Wightman University.<br><br>The phone twitched again as he fumbled in his pocket. He was addled, groggy, a miner regaining consciousness after a cave-in. What time was it? What day? What <i>century</i>? Mandatory question in his line of work. Nat was a history professor. Specialty: Modern Germany. At Wightman that covered everything from the Weimar Republic of 1919 onward, and while Nat was in love with the sweep and grandeur of the whole era, neither friend nor foe was under any illusion as to his true calling. He remained as thoroughly haunted by the long shadow of the Third Reich as those Hitler-centric folks on the History Channel. In Nat&#x2019;s treasure hunts, X never marked the spot. A swastika did, or some pile of old bones. Dig at risk of contamination.<br><br>He snicked open the phone, and the blue glow offered a beacon of hope until he saw the incoming number. Gordon Wolfe, his onetime master and commander, calling at 1:04 a.m., meant Nat was about to be subjected to an angry tirade or a teary confessional, and either would likely be served in a marinade of French cognac and Kentucky bourbon. He answered with a vague sense of stage fright.<br><br>&#x201c;Gordon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s Viv. Gordon&#x2019;s in jail. You have to get up here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jail? What&#x2019;s happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They took him away. Him and some archives. They took everything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gordon&#x2019;s archives? <i>All</i> of them? Where are you, Viv?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Blue Kettle Lake. Our summer place.&#x201d;<br><br>The Adirondacks. Of course. That was where the old Minotaur always retreated when the going got tough, and lately the going had been unbearable.<br><br>&#x201c;The police handcuffed him the moment we walked in the door. You&#x2019;d have thought he was John Dillinger. They&#x2019;re saying he stole it, that he stole everything, which is nuts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stole what, Viv? Slow down. Start at the beginning.&#x201d;<br><br>By now the phone light had switched off. Nat, sole survivor of the European Research Collection, again sat in the darkness of carrel C-19 in the basement stacks of Hartsell Library. He had often boasted he could find his way out of here blindfolded. Tonight he might have to put up or shut up.<br><br>His nose could have told him the approximate location&#x2014;musty leather bindings, chilled concrete, the chemical reek of spooled ?microfilm&#x2014;a bouquet that probably explained why he had just been dreaming of a similar place across the Atlantic. Except there all the writing was in German and the records were haunted by so much industrialized horror that you never got comfy enough to nod off.<br><br>In his dream he had been visiting the place during wartime, a quarter century before he was born. He was descending a narrow stairway as bombs crashed overhead, and he was vaguely excited, as if on the verge of a huge discovery. Yet at each passing level the light dimmed, his dread deepened, and a grim realization took hold: The closer he got to his goal, the greater the risk that he would lose his way or be buried in rubble, forever irretrievable by family and friends.<br><br>Guilt having its say, no doubt. Work had consumed the better part of Nat&#x2019;s last two decades, dating back to his undergraduate years, when a dynamic professor named Gordon Wolfe had infected him with a virulent strain of historical curiosity. The affliction had now outlasted the aforementioned marriage, a procession of careless affairs, and the upbringing of a daughter who had just finished her sophomore year at Wightman. This being a party-hearty Thursday following final exams, Karen was probably seated at this very moment with her friends around a noisy table, polishing off a celebratory pitcher of beer.<br><br>Nat had canceled a dinner date to come to the library. It seemed necessary at the time. But so far the only fruits of his labor were an unscheduled nap, and now he had learned that Gordon Wolfe was in jail in upstate New York, where the old man apparently would remain until Nat could talk Gordon&#x2019;s wife, Vivian, down from the high ledge of hysteria. Judging from her voice, she had been perched there quite a while.<br><br>&#x201c;It was some old files,&#x201d; Viv said. &#x201c;Gordon says they were planted. That&#x2019;s all I could get out of him before they took him away. They bumped his head on the goddamn patrol car. We didn&#x2019;t even have time to take off our coats. When we turned on the light there was a pile of boxes sitting there, right on the kitchen table. Then a bunch of FBI guys came in from the living room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The FBI? Good Lord. What kind of files?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Something from the war. Gordon can tell you. I got the idea he&#x2019;d seen them before, just never at our house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Two boxes? Ten?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Four. They moved everything to the sunroom before I got a good look, and now I can&#x2019;t even get in there. I&#x2019;m a prisoner in my own house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You see any labels? Any markings?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A few stickers. Ask Gordon. But first we&#x2019;ve got to get him out. They haven&#x2019;t set bail, but I can take care of that. I want you here for the arraignment. We can ride over together, tell the judge it&#x2019;s all a lie.&#x201d;<br><br>Unless it wasn&#x2019;t. Frame-up or not, what in the hell was Gordon Wolfe doing at the age of eighty-four with a missing archive at his summer home in the hills? Especially if it was the archive, the one Gordon had forever mooned about to both students and colleagues in his less-guarded and more-imbibed moments. More than sixty years ago he had been one of the few wartime caretakers of that trove. Then, after the war ended, four boxes full of information had slipped through everyone&#x2019;s fingers, disappearing somewhere between the Alps of Switzerland and the towers of midtown Manhattan.<br><br>Gordon had been looking for this lost treasure ever since, and during particularly acute outbreaks of gold fever he sounded like an old prospector around a campfire. He had even brought up the subject at his long-overdue retirement party, a melancholy event six years ago when everyone but Gordon had been at a loss for words, stifled by the awkward knowledge that Wightman was nudging him not so gently into the box marked &#x201c;Emeritus.&#x201d; What was it Gordon had said that day as he blustered on? Some bold proclamation while he waved his drink, his blocky head thrust forward like that of a reckless boxer, punch-drunk and asking for more. Now Nat remembered:<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s out there, all right. Nobody burned it. Nobody bombed it. But somebody took it, and I wish I knew who, &#x2019;cause it&#x2019;s got secrets you can&#x2019;t find anywhere else. Not a dud among &#x2019;em. Live ammunition. Pick it up and it might go off in your hands. <i>Boom!</i>&#x201d;<br><br>Whereupon he sloshed bourbon onto the tie of the assistant dean for students.<br><br>Gordon&#x2019;s mother lode was a trove of wartime gleanings from an American OSS station in Bern, Switzerland, which had been a listening post in a zone of tense but genteel neutrality. Right on Hitler&#x2019;s doorstep, as historians such as Nat liked to say. It was run by Allen Dulles, the genial, pipe-smoking Lothario who a few years later became one of the first chiefs of the CIA, making him the nation&#x2019;s ranking Cold Warrior. The missing boxes were only a fraction of the voluminous files Dulles collected during the war, of course. And much of his other work had been well documented, most notably in accounts of the German double agent Fritz Kolbe, who smuggled secret documents out of the Nazi Foreign Ministry by taping them around his thigh.<br><br>Gordon ended up working for the OSS literally by accident. Dulles arrived in Switzerland by train only hours before Vichy France shut its borders in late &#x2019;41. Cut off from reinforcements, he cobbled together a staff from borrowed diplomats, marooned American bankers and ?students, disaffected expat Junkers, a Swiss financier&#x2019;s wife who was a former Boston debutante&#x2014;who, conveniently, also became his ?mistress&#x2014;and American airmen whose bombers crash-landed in Switzerland.<br><br>Gordon was one of the downed airmen, selected by Dulles mostly because of his fluency in German. It saved him from spending the rest of the war in a Swiss internment camp, although by his own account he was little more than a clerk, translating speeches and making sure Dulles never ran out of paper clips. Gordon compensated for this lack of espionage glamour by telling hair-raising tales of his missions as a ball turret gunner in a Flying Fortress on bombing runs over Germany. To drive home the point, he wore a battered leather flight jacket and walked with a limp&#x2014;the result, he said, of a flak b...</p><h2>Contemporary Calligraphy: How to Use Formal Scripts Today</h2><p>&#39;Contemporary Calligraphy&#39; describes in detail, and demonstrates clearly through the many accompanying diagrams, how to write formal scripts well and then adapt and vary them to enhance and interpret texts.</p><p>Gillian Hazeldine is a Fellow of the Society of Scribes and Illuminators (SSI) and a Full Member of Letter Exchange.

If the afternoon had been any colder, Sam and his partner Russell Trail would have stayed in the truck, heater blasting, waiting for them to catch up. But spring had finally come to northwestern Indiana, with temperatures in the 50s and the skies clear. Sam got out of the truck and surveyed the landscape: miles of farmland dotted with silos and barns. Dead trees lined the side of the road. The warmer weather was thawing out the cornfields from the winter freeze.<br>It was Tuesday, April 22, 1980. Sam and the rest of the crew were repairing winter damage to a section of County Road 400 North, known locally as Hopkins Park Road. One of the few paved east-west roads in the area, Hopkins Park Road connected busy Route 41 on the western edge of Indiana with the little town of Hopkins Park in far-eastern Illinois, 40 miles south of Chicago. Sam and Russell squirted oil in the cracks and the second crew came along behind sprinkling little rocks in the oil, creating what is called a &#x201c;chip-along&#x201d; road surface. But Sam and Russell had gotten too far ahead. The oil would harden before the second crew got there with the rocks.<br>As Sam stood on the roadway, he let his eyes wander to the surrounding farmland. That&#x2019;s when he saw it, lying in the weeds on the far upslope of a drainage ditch that ran parallel to the road. A wooden box. It was about five feet long and a couple feet wide&#x2014;the size and shape of the toolboxes in the beds of pickups. Sam pointed it out to his partner. They trudged into the three-foot-deep ditch and walked up the other side to get a closer look. From its darkened, weathered surface, the box appeared to have been outside for some time. It looked to have been constructed by hand with plywood and finishing nails.<br>They picked it up and carried it back up to the roadway, where they set it down next to the truck. With a crowbar from the truck, Sam pried open the lid and peered inside. A faintly musty smell hit him. Stuffed inside were a soiled blanket or quilt, green and old, and a tangle of clothes made of denim and plaid cloth. Sam poked at the quilt with the crowbar, pushing it aside to see what was underneath.<br>As an object appeared, he gasped. Sam shouted to the other workers to stay right where they were until he called for help. He jumped into the pickup cab and radioed his boss, Highway Superintendent Ernie Collins, telling him to come out to Hopkins Park Road, just a couple miles west of 41, immediately.<br>The old quilt in the box was covering a human skull.<br>Larry Bartley had been driving home in his work car, a white Malibu station wagon, when over the radio he heard the dispatcher say, &#x201c;Signal 8&#x2014;10-79 at 400 north, west of US 41 in Newton.&#x201d; A crime scene technician for Newton County, Bartley knew the lingo: a body had been found on Hopkins Park Road. Turning around, he drove five miles to a spot on the road just west of Route 41 where he saw the highway workers standing near an old, weathered wooden box. They looked shaken, their faces ghostly white. At about the same time he arrived, his friend, Newton County Sheriff&#x2019;s Deputy Gerald Burman, pulled up in his chocolate-brown-and-tan Ford LTD cruiser. Also arriving were Sheriff Ed Madison and the county&#x2019;s part-time elected coroner, Pat Cardwell, a funeral home owner.<br>As Sheriff Madison interviewed the road workers and Deputy Burman posted himself a few hundred yards up the road to keep cars away, Bartley took pictures of the scene from various angles with his 35-mm Pentax, first in black-and-white, then in color. He also photographed the box. On paper, he diagramed the location where the box was found&#x2014;the weeds had been tramped down and were dead. When he finished documenting the scene, he looked inside the box.<br>Pushing the matted and rolled-up blanket and clothing around, Bartley could see that there wasn&#x2019;t just a skull, but dozens of other bones, enough to make up an entire skeleton. With darkness approaching, Bartley wanted to get the box into a protected, lighted place. He helped Cardwell load it into the coroner&#x2019;s station wagon, then the pair drove separately to the Cardwell Funeral Home in the hamlet of Morocco, eight miles to the south. Bartley and Cardwell carried the box inside, placing it on an embalming table and pulling off the lid that Sam Kennedy had partially pried off with a crowbar.<br>Wearing rubber gloves, they removed the quilt first. Up closer, it looked more like an Army blanket, though it was badly soiled. They removed, logged and placed into brown bags a collection of women&#x2019;s clothing that seemed to come straight from the 60s: bell-bottom blue jeans, a turquoise hippie-type blouse with wooden buttons, a badly decomposed white nightgown, another white nightgown with a lace top, a bright red dress, a multi-colored dress with puffy sleeves, a blue dress, a black-and-white dress, a striped shirt, a plaid skirt, a blue Western-style shirt, a bathrobe and several bras. There was also a pair of blue jeans with a picture of a smiling mushroom on the crotch. Nearly all the items were size small. They also removed two rings, a gold crucifix on a chain, and strands of brownish hair.<br>With the clothing out of the way, Bartley and Cardwell could see that the bones were dry and stained dark, the soft tissues of the muscles, skin and organs eaten away by insects and the elements. There was the skull that had startled Sam Kennedy, along with the collarbones, chest bone, ribs, vertebrae, arm bones and the little bones of the hands. The bones appeared to be those of a woman or a small-framed male; they were too big to be those of a child.<br>But what was most intriguing were the bones of the lower legs. They had been cut a couple inches down from the knee. The rest of the leg bones and the feet were missing. The person in the box had had his or her legs chopped off at the shins.<br>Bartley and Cardwell decided to leave the bones in the box for the time being. Bartley put the bagged clothing and quilt in his car and drove home. The next day, he checked the bags into the evidence room of the Indiana State Police post in Lowell.<br>Over the next two weeks, the box with the bones was carted across northern Indiana in a quest to figure out whom they belonged to and what had happened to this person. A forensic pathologist at the Physicians Laboratory in Lafayette examined the bones and determined they were those of a woman between the ages of 20 and 40 years, and that it looked like the legs had been sliced off with a power saw. The bones then went to Purdue University for an examination by an anthropologist, who believed the woman was probably in her early twenties, with brown hair. The condition of the pelvis showed that she had borne no children. She may have been Hispanic, but the anthropologist wasn&#x2019;t sure. The bone structure of the skull and exceptional teeth suggested that she was very pretty.<br>Word quickly spread through Newton County about the discovery of what would be called The Lady in the Box. A front-page story in the Newton County Enterprise on May 1, 1980, said &#x201c;Box Lady Remains A Mystery&#x201d; and quoted &#x201c;one informed source&#x201d; as saying that police in Indiana were pursuing &#x201c;significant leads&#x201d; in the case. The source told the paper that if it turned out The Lady in the Box was murdered, &#x201c;This will be one of the most bizarre cases in Newton County history.&#x201d;<br>Seeking her identity, authorities put out the word over the police network systems to other agencies asking if they had any missing women fitting that description: young, brown-haired, possibly Latina, and attractive. The chopped-off legs weren&#x2019;t mentioned&#x2014;that was supposed to be the truth test if anybody responded&#x2014;but the grisly detail got leaked to the local media anyway.<br>Despite the optimistic tone in the Enterprise, the investigation was actually going nowhere. No replies had come in with anything close to a woman or girl fitting the description of The Lady in the Box. Newton County sheriffs contacted the Chicago Police Department to see if the remains matched those of any missing big-city women; it was not uncommon for the bodies of homicide victims to turn up buried in Newton County farmland. &#x201c;We used to joke that they did it here because the soil was soft and sandy,&#x201d; Burman recalled. The size of the skeleton allowed authorities to quickly rule out the possibility that this was a missing woman in a notorious case of the time&#x2014;the 1977 disappearance of candy heiress Helen Vorhees Brach, from suburban Chicago. Police combed their files for missing prostitutes or drug addicts, but found nothing.<br>After several weeks, the investigation had stalled and authorities were beginning to resign themselves to the possibility that The Lady in the Box might always remain a Jane Doe, and so decided to give her a proper burial. But first they kept some of the evidence in case a tip came in. The quilt, the clothing and the box were left in storage in the state police post in Lowell. Also kept were the lower leg bones in case a weapon or tool turned up that could be matched against the cut marks. Coroner Cardwell kept the skull for himself, storing it at the funeral home.<br>Under Indiana law, unclaimed remains must be buried in the township in which they were found. These remains were discovered closest to McClelland Township in Newton County, but the township had no cemetery. The Lady in the Box was to be laid to rest in the next closest township, Morocco, in the potter&#x2019;s field section of Oakwood Cemetery. The bones were put in white plastic bags, which were placed in an inexpensive, plastic child-sized coffin. It was a simple burial, attended by Coroner Cardwell, crime scene technician Bartley and a small crew from the cemetery that did the digging. No words were spoken that anybody could remember. A metal plate was ordered for a marker. Since nobody knew her name, or her date of birth or death, the marker read, &#x201c;Jane Doe, 1980.&#x201d;<br>Over the years, The Lady in the Box became a local legend. Teenagers would go to Hopkins Park Road west of Route 41 to check out the very spot where she was found by Sam Kennedy that pleasant spring afternoon. Those who weren&#x2019;t morbidly fascinated by her grew to feel compassion, this unknown woman abandoned on the side of the road, evoking sympathy and a curious sense of protectiveness, her anonymity allowing people to create their own histories for her. Flowers would be found on the Jane Doe marker at Oakwood Cemetery. Cemetery workers tried to see who brought them, and a couple of times saw a car drive off, but they couldn&#x2019;t get the license plate. Thinking the flowers might have been left by the killer out of guilt, Newton County authorities set up a stake-out at the cemetery. Soon, they saw a woman leaving flowers on the marker. The woman turned out to be no killer, but a relative of somebody else buried in the cemetery. When she came to put flowers on her loved one&#x2019;s grave, she would save a few for The Lady in the Box because she felt sorry for her. In time, the original marker was stolen, then replaced by a New Age-looking one with a circle pattern&#x2014;why and by whom, nobody knew.<br>As years passed, the investigation would be as dead as anybody in Oakwood Cemetery. There were no leads, no reports of missing women or girls fitting her description. There was nothing to do but to remember. Bartley, the crime scene analyst, would stop by the jail occasionally and ask Burman, &#x201c;Heard anything about The Lady in the Box?&#x201d; And Burman would reply, &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t heard a word. Nothing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Any open case always haunts you, for lack of a better word,&#x201d; Bartley would say years later. &#x201c;You try to pride yourself that you&#x2019;re better than the average bear, so to speak, and you&#x2019;re going to get your man. And if you don&#x2019;t, it eats at you, not bad, but it gnaws.&#x201d;<br>It would gnaw at him for more than twenty years.<br></p><h2>Equal Time for Pogo</h2><p>A collection of Pogo comic strips from 1968, focusing on the Presidential race and the anti-war politics of the day.

My wife answers with the same exaggerated singsong lilt as the woman on the disc, and it is starting to grate on me. Certainly it is a credit to Thia that she is using our five days of driving to the border as a time to begin learning the language, but it has something of the same effect on me that songs tallying bottles of beer used to have when returning from camp. It is Election Day, and it is pouring sheets here in Ohio as autumn lightning crackles down onto the plains. When we pull off the highway to fill up, I see lines of people outside a school building, holding umbrellas or turning their collars up, waiting to vote. Thia and I have cast absentee ballots in our Connecticut town before leaving -- as it happens, I was in the college class between the two presidential candidates -- but if there is any astral, or political, sign in our departure, it is not of our making.</p><p>The election results unfold for us in a motel in Ohio, where it continues to pour. We wonder, in passing, what effect the lashing rain might have on the voter turnout here. Thia and I resume our drive the next morning, and the weather clears. She puts on her Spanish drills again (yes, she is a <i>norteamericana,</i> but I cannot think of a time in Mexico in the next two years when we'll be called that), and we strike a time-sharing compromise: I am finally able to tune into my newest toy, a satellite radio. With 120 channels, it turns a long drive into a continuous sampling of music, news, and sports -- Mozart, classic rock, crooners of the thirties, Debussy, even a twenty-four-hour Elvis channel, plus NPR and the talk shows, all thrashing out the election results.</p><p>Although we are on our way to simplify our lives, it will not be without some of our society's more useful technology. Mine is the first generation since the rise of the Internet and the technology boom to try out the expatriate life. We may not need our TV -- we have not brought along a set -- but we <i>do</i> want our laptops, our DVD players, our iPods, our Wi-Fi cards.</p><p>Our car is a midsize used Japanese SUV I bought recently on eBay. It is hardly a smart choice of car, since it is not serviced in Mexico, and it is not particularly economical or environmentally friendly. But it is a strong, rugged beast, and we didn't want to trade it in for a lesser breed; at least it is a four-wheel drive vehicle. Mexico, as we knew from a previous visit, offered ample opportunities to test a car's constitution. The topes -- vicious speed bumps that appear out of nowhere approaching towns and villages -- were enough to require reinforced shocks, and any detours could involve streams, mud, and rocks.</p><p>It also had enough cargo room for the stuff we were bringing for a first year's stay in Mexico. Thia decided suitcases would only be a nuisance to store in the apartment we would be renting, and a pain to pack in the car, so instead we filled sixteen large steel-reinforced plastic trash bags with our (all-summer) clothes, our laptops, a printer, a fan, our flippers, a multitude of CDs and books, a stereo, and a foldable bookcase.</p><p>By afternoon of the next day, in Missouri, we switch off the satellite radio in favor of an audio book of Mark Twain readings. As we have planned our rambling route, we cross the big river not that far from Hannibal listening to excerpts from <i>Life on the Mississippi.</i> We are in no hurry to reach the Mexican border. We have traveled with our boys throughout the United States and in Europe, and always enjoyed the going as much as the getting there.</p><p>To easterners, Europe seems closer than Mexico. In the East, our superficial image of Mexico is shaped by what we read or see on television or when immigration issues are in the public eye: a poor country with good resorts, lousy water, spicy food, dangerous <i>bandidos,</i> a colorful history, and a hard-working people -- a good number of whom might, at any moment, be poised at the Rio Grande, paying unscrupulous smugglers their life's savings to ferry them across to do America's lowest-paid work. When we get exercised about illegal immigration, as we do every few years, we notice the Mexicans in our midst, laboring in our fields and our cities. But we do not trouble ourselves to know much beyond the clich�s about Mexico, or about the Mexicans who remain and reside in their own country. In the East we are exposed to a less nuanced image of Mexico than are residents of California or the Southwest. But it's safe to say that a mix of apprehension and condescension toward our southern neighbor seems to be pervasively, reflexively American. Sorry, <i>North</i> American.</p><p>In our family, there was a different tradition. It may not have been in our blood -- we're pretty much Irish-French -- but living in Mexico for a time was part of our family history. My paternal grandfather lived and worked in Chihuahua, in northern Mexico, at the turn of the last century. My father, a mining equipment salesman, was transferred to Mexico City in 1952, and we spent seven years there, leaving when I was twelve. I forgot much of my Spanish and did not return to Mexico until I was an adult.</p><p>Though I passed some formative years there, Mexico faded from my mind. My family moved to Europe -- I met my future wife's family there -- but I went to high school and college in the States and worked in America's big cities. I retained a warm feeling for the years I spent in Mexico City, which was then a balmy city of a few million. It seemed to me, young as I was, a fabled, romantic time of my life. But later, as time went on, I became no less susceptible than other Americans to the drumbeat of press reports about Mexico's unstable finances, poverty-stricken citizenry, and crime in the border cities, to say nothing of the effects of drinking the tap water.</p><p>In fact, after we announced our decision to our larger circle of friends, it was surprising how many had their own personal horror stories to relate, and how eagerly they told them. Just before we left, there was a good-bye party for us in New York at our in-laws' apartment. Our friends came to wish us well. One, a svelte, smart New York City judge and an experienced world traveler, told us she had visited Mexico only once and had been shipped home feet first, retching. A soft-spoken sister-in-law was uncharacteristically agitated when she talked about a friend who had once been stopped by police in Mexico and taken off to jail on spurious charges. A couple of friends from the suburbs mentioned kidnappings in Mexico City and the rash of stories about violence in the border cities.</p><p>At the party, after we cut the celebratory cake that was bought for us, several of my male friends put their arm around my shoulder.</p><p>"You <i>dog,"</i> said a lifelong buddy. "We're so goddamn envious."</p><p>"You're paving the way," said another friend and fellow writer. "You're going to live the dream."</p><p>That is what they were saying. But by the way they squeezed my shoulder, kneading it sympathetically, I knew it was more than happiness or even a touch of envy they felt for us -- they were wishing us luck, as if they feared we would need it.</p><p>After a final Stateside lunch on San Antonio's voguish riverfront, we are in Laredo, Texas, approaching the border. Thia and I rehearse our plans. The guidebooks and websites have advised us what we can legally take across the border. Among other things, we are declaring only the ten books and twenty CDs we are allowed under a tourist visa, and have written a list to that effect, translating it into formal Spanish on Google's language site.</p><p>We are taking a risk by failing to declare the fifty CDs and the sixty or so books we are actually carrying. We will be applying for a tourist visa even though we intend to stay for at least a year, and will wait to get a resident visa at our destination in Mexico. That will eventually allow us to bring over a virtually unlimited number of household goods, but for now we have to make do with what tourists do. We are resigned to what may happen if the Mexican border police give us the notorious red light, which randomly singles out travelers for a major inspection. We know we face duty and a possible fine if our international music- and book-smuggling operation is uncovered.</p><p>In downtown Laredo, we pick up our Mexican insurance papers; American insurance is not valid in Mexico. Nasty stories about uninsured accidents in Mexico are a cottage industry online, not least because so many Mexican drivers do not themselves carry insurance -- or driver's licenses, for that matter. In Mexico, we hear, with a legal system in part based on the Napoleonic code, guilt is sometimes assumed and innocence must be proved. If papers are not in order, or there are any discrepancies at the scene of a fender bender, it is not unknown for the police to escort both drivers to a jail until it can be sorted out.</p><p>We head for the international border.</p><p>In the middle of the bridge spanning the Rio Grande, we pass into Mexico. American customs is uninterested in those of us leaving, while at the Mexican booth, an unsmiling man in uniform peers in at us and nods us through. It's a false positive, we know. The real customs stop is twelve miles down the highway, through a "free trade zone," in which U.S. residents can make casual day trips with a minimum of red tape. Those of us going further face the gauntlet. It is an instructive experience to cross the border by car, unlike flying into a Mexican airport, where you encounter only gradual changes amid the familiar glass and chrome of the arrivals building. In a car, you are immersed in the new culture instantly.</p><p>On the streets of Nuevo Laredo, the potholed pavement, littered sidewalks, dilapidated buildings, horizontal traffic lights, and a swelter of unfamiliar signage hit us at once. An old gentleman in a straw hat pulls out in front of us, on...</p></p><h2>The Motive (Dismas Hardy, Book 10)</h2><p>In the wake of the high-profile double murders of a politically connected socialite and his glamorous fianc�e, Abe Glitsky is placed at the head of the controversial investigation, which is complicated by a distrustful officer who uses the victim&#39;s past relationship with Glitsky&#39;s partner, Hardy, to contend that they are guilty of collusion.

Overall, the story suffers from bloat, smart characters who act stupidly at the author's convenience, and an unconvincing ending. But clever characterizations and a solid mystery prevail, and the skilled and agile reading of David Colacci keeps it involving. While Colacci does not excel at distinctive characterizations, we always know who's who in each scene, and he makes up for any lack with an engaging voice and good pacing.

Andy Goldsworthy</h2><p>Time, always an element in the work of Andy Goldsworthy, both as a medium and as a metaphor, is celebrated in this book. The text is comprised of Goldsworthy&#39;s own diaries.</p><p>Whether measured in minutes or eons, time is a good friend of British artist Andy Goldsworthy's. He spends long, solitary days outdoors in all kinds of weather, doing things like piecing together many, many yellow leaves to create a brilliant band of color at a river's edge in upstate New York or stacking small pieces of ice on the Nova Scotia coast to build a sculpture in the compact shape of an ancient stone monument. Threatened by a strong gust of wind, the incoming tide, or a sudden rise in temperature, these are fugitive works comfortably in synch with the natural rhythms of growth and decay.<p> Other works of his are longer-lasting. In walls made of stacked stones with hollowed-out oval "chambers" the size of his body--which he began building in 1999 in Lancashire, England--Goldsworthy makes reference not only to the shapes of graves in a nearby church but also to his personal history in the region and the enduring qualities of a rugged landscape.</p><p> Goldsworthy is the rare artist who can describe what he does in simple, concrete terms that nonetheless reveal his larger vision. <i>Time</i> is a very satisfying collection of 500 photographs, nearly all taken by him, that document the creation and subsequent mutations of his work. These evocative images are illuminated by excerpts from the diaries he kept as he created five projects in Europe and North America in the '90s. He discusses what it's like to explore an unfamiliar landscape, assess how the elements will work for and against him, and perform what are essentially a set of experiments. Success means making work that is, as he writes, "completely welded to its site." <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p>ANDY GOLDSWORTHY's books include Abrams' <i>Stone, Wood, Arch, Wall, Hand to Earth</i>, <i>Passage, Enclosure</i>, and <i>Andy Goldsworthy: A Collaboration with Nature</i>.

US Army CID Sergeants George Sue�o and Ernie Bascom are assigned an underwhelming case of petty theft: Major Frederick M. Schulz has accused Miss Jo Kyong-ja, an Itaewon bar girl, of stealing twenty-five thousand <i>won</i> from him&#x2014;a sum equaling less than fifty US dollars. After two very divergent accounts of what happened, Miss Jo is attacked, and Schulz is found hacked to death only days later. Did tensions simply escalate to the point of murder?<br><br>Looking into other motives for Schulz&#x2019;s death, George and Ernie discover that the major was investigating the 501st Military Intelligence Battalion: the Army&#x2019;s counterintelligence arm, solely dedicated to tracking North Korean spies. The division is rife with suspects, but it&#x2019;s dangerous to speak out against them in a period of Cold War finger-pointing. As George and Ernie go head-to-head with the battalion&#x2019;s powerful, intimidating commander, Lance Blood, they learn that messing with the 501st can have very personal consequences.</p><p>Martin Lim�n retired from military service after twenty years in the US Army, including ten years in Korea.

We started talking, I bought her a drink. Then we went back to her hooch.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s her name?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Miss Jo.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Did you check her VD card?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good idea. If she&#x2019;s a freelancer without one, we might have trouble finding her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This made him even angrier. &#x201c;She stole my money, dammit. I want it back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Kim, the statuesque Admin secretary, pulled a tissue from the box in front of her, held it to her nose, rose from her chair, and walked out of the office. We listened as her high heels clicked down the hallway.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is George Sue�o. I&#x2019;m an agent for the 8th United States Army Criminal Investigation Division in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Reports of theft were routinely taken at the Yongsan Compound MP Station. But Major Schultz knew Colonel Brace, the Provost Marshal, and had gone to him directly with his complaint. Since he was a field grade officer, it was felt that allowing word of this incident to leak out to the hoi polloi of the Military Police would be detrimental to good order and discipline. So my partner Ernie Bascom and I&#x2014;CID agents, not MP investigators&#x2014;were given the job.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schultz told me that he&#x2019;d left the UN Club with Miss Jo and they&#x2019;d walked back to her hooch near the old oak tree behind the Itaewon open-air market. In her room, he handed her fifty dollars&#x2019; worth of crisp MPC, military payment certificates. She&#x2019;d taken the bills, helped him off with his clothes and sat him down on the edge of the bed. Then she excused herself to use the outdoor <i>byonso</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I waited and waited,&#x201d; he told me, &#x201c;until finally I got tired of waiting. So I slid open the door and looked out. Nothing. No light on in the <i>byonso</i>. I put on my clothes and went looking for her. She was gone. I pounded on the doors in the neighbors&#x2019; hooches, but they just pretended not to speak English.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Maybe they don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This made him angry again. Full cheeks flushed red. Even beneath his blond crew cut, freckled skin burned crimson. &#x201c;They live next door to a GI whore and they don&#x2019;t speak English?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shrugged. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;d you do?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knotted his fists. &#x201c;I was tempted to tear the place down, rip up her clothes, smash the windows, throw the freaking radio and electric fan out into the mud. But I figured if I did, she might slap a SOFA charge on me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SOFA. The Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and the Republic of Korea. One of its provisions is to adjudicate claims made by Korean civilians against US military personnel for damages suffered at their hands.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It was almost midnight curfew,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;so I just put on my clothes and left.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Smart move,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded. &#x201c;I tell you, though, if I&#x2019;d gotten my hands on her . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We let the thought trail off.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Are you on an accompanied tour?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unconsciously, he fondled the gold wedding band on his left hand. &#x201c;No. The wife&#x2019;s back at Fort Hood.&#x201d; I continued to stare at him. &#x201c;The kids are in school. We thought it was best not to move them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finished my typing, looked up at him and said, &#x201c;Can you describe Miss Jo?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did. But it amounted to the same bargirl description we heard from most GIs: brunette, petite, cute foreign accent. Ernie looked at me and rolled his eyes. I stopped typing and asked Major Schultz to accompany us to the Itaewon Police Station. He agreed, and the three of us walked outside to Ernie&#x2019;s jeep.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once there, I conferred with the on-duty Desk Sergeant. After a few minutes, he ushered us into a back room, pulled out a huge loose-ring binder and plopped it on a wooden table. The book contained information gathered by the Yongsan District Public Health Service and was accompanied with snapshots of every waitress and barmaid and hostess who was authorized to work in the Itaewon nightclub district.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girls are issued a wallet-sized card and are required to be checked monthly for communicable diseases. If they prove to be disease-free, the card is stamped in red ink. If they&#x2019;re sick, they are locked up in a Health Service Quarantine Center and forced to take whatever drugs the doctor prescribes. GIs call the wallet-sized folds of cardboard &#x201c;VD cards.&#x201d; In official military training, soldiers are instructed to check that the card is up-to-date before having sexual relations. As you might imagine, few bother.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Desk Sergeant left, Major Schultz flipped through a few dozen pages of the book until he found the section marked <i>UN Club</i>. He stopped and pointed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I studied the picture. She wasn&#x2019;t hard to look at. A face that could&#x2019;ve belonged to a classic Korean heroine: a perfectly shaped oval, narrow eyes, clear complexion, all framed by straight black hair falling to narrow shoulders. And maybe it was my imagination, but I thought she looked wistful, slightly ashamed at being photographed for a VD Card but resigned nevertheless to her fate. Next to the photo, written in <i>hangul</i>, were her name, date of birth, and National ID card number. I jotted down the info.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Schultz rose from his wooden chair. &#x201c;When do you expect to catch her?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;If she hasn&#x2019;t left town, it won&#x2019;t take long,&#x201d; I replied.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It better not.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned and stalked out of the police station.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 2</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Ernie and I drove back to the CID office. Staff Sergeant Riley, the Admin Non-Commissioned Officer, sat behind a stack of neatly clipped paperwork.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Miss Kim?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Riley replied. &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t work for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was him. All charm.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;She seemed shaken up listening to Major Schultz.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Riley shrugged and returned to his paperwork. Ernie ignored our conversation, picked up the morning edition of the <i>Pacific Stars and Stripes</i>, sat down, and snapped it open to the sports page. Tissue was still wadded atop Miss Kim&#x2019;s desk and her full cup of green tea had grown cold.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to look for her.<br> &nbsp;<br> I found her sitting on a wooden bench beside a small pagoda containing a bronze statue of the Maitreya Buddha. It had been set up years ago for the use of 8th Army&#x2019;s Korean employees, of which there were hundreds on this compound alone. A small grassy area in front of the shrine was well worn from spirited games of badminton that were held every day during lunch hour.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat down next to Miss Kim. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry Major Schultz upset you,&#x201d; I told her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She twisted her handkerchief, rolling pink embroidery around the edges. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not him,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then what is it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn&#x2019;t answer. About a year ago, she and Ernie had been an item. She&#x2019;d taken the relationship seriously. Ernie hadn&#x2019;t. He was tall, about six-foot-one, and had a pointed nose with green eyes that sat behind round-lensed glasses. Why women found him fascinating, I wasn&#x2019;t sure. Maybe it was his complete I-don&#x2019;t-give-a-damn attitude. Ernie&#x2019;d served two tours in Vietnam, and having survived that, he figured every day was money won in a poker game; he spent them as such, taking any pleasure that came his way. When Miss Kim found out that he had other paramours, she dropped him flat. As far as I knew, she hadn&#x2019;t spoken to him since.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;If it&#x2019;s not Major Schultz that&#x2019;s bothering you,&#x201d; I asked, &#x201c;then what is it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shook her head, staring at the dirt in front of us. &#x201c;Cruelty,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;So much of it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I patted her hand. She dabbed her eyes with the handkerchief. I&#x2019;d known her for well over a year now. I occasionally bought her gifts from the PX: a flower, small bottles of hand lotion, the type of breath mints I knew she liked. I suppose I was trying to make amends for the sins of my investigative partner. When she didn&#x2019;t continue, I said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something else bothering you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed but stopped abruptly. &#x201c;You notice things, don&#x2019;t you, Geogie?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I try to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There is something,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing, really.&#x201d; She waved her hand in a dismissive gesture. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that when I walk home, after the cannon goes off, somebody keeps staring at me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Kim was tall and slender and dressed well, which attracted a lot of attention on a compound full of horny GIs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Did he do anything?&#x201d; I asked. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Not exactly. While I&#x2019;m heading toward the Main Gate, he follows me. And lately he&#x2019;s been walking up right beside me and when no one else is listening, he says things. Rude things. I ignore him, but he keeps doing it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How long has this been going on?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Maybe two or three weeks now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Describe him to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shook her head vehemently. &#x201c;No. I don&#x2019;t want trouble.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Korean War had ended some twenty years ago. Seoul had been completely crushed, and only now was the Korean economy beginning to recover. A job on the American Army compound was considered an excellent employment opportunity, with good pay and job security. Miss Kim was afraid to jeopardize that in any way.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she turned on the bench and stared at me. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do anything, Geogie. I can take care of it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Has this guy followed you off compound?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No. He always stops just before we reach the Pedestrian Exit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;At Gate Five?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Where there are more people.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She nodded, then reached out and squeezed my hand. &#x201c;Thank you, though,&#x201d; she said. Then she pointed at her nose. &#x201c;I will take care of it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked back to the CID office. Before we entered, she stopped and faced me again. &#x201c;Promise you won&#x2019;t do anything?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled and trotted up the steps.</p><h2>Dhammapada: The Teachings of the Buddha</h2><p>This classic book has a beautiful embossed cover in purple and gold.

Inspector Luke Thanet, the hero of Dorothy Simpson's series of mysteries set in England, has a murder <i>and</i> a wedding on his hands in <i>Once Too Often</i>. The wedding is his daughter's, and her future life partner has Thanet not a little worried; it comes almost as a relief, then, when the case of a possibly murdered newspaper reporter distracts him from more personal concerns. The victim, Jessica Dander, was found lying at the foot of her stairs with a broken neck. Though it looks like an accident, given the dead woman's unfortunately long list of enemies, murder cannot be counted out. As Thanet and his partner quietly go about the business of solving Dander's death, readers are treated to a well-written, carefully plotted story and characters whose portraits are richly detailed.Inspector Thanet, of the town of Sturrenden, called to the scene of what looks to be an accidental death, finds a myriad of lies that point instead to murder. For Thanet, Terrence Hardiman uses a natural speaking voice, with intonations matching the emotional states of the inspector. Hardiman gives Sergeant Mike Lineham a keener, crisper accent, which reflects his youth and vigor. He varies his tones, pronunciations, and rate of speech as he portrays the minor characters, highlighting his ability to play many roles. Hardiman slips easily into a cockney accent with the blue-collar characters, and these become his best efforts. The numerous voices parallel the complex plot of the story.

A friend and muse also to Rodin, Epstein and Hoffmansthal, the daughter of wealthy Americans, Gladys's childhood was overshadowed by her father's imprisonment for murdering her mother's lover. Leaving the States for Europe, with her glamorous yet formidable mother, at the height of the belle epoque, she became adored and admired in the finest literary and aristocratic circles. In England she became a favourite guest at Blenheim during the Duke of Marlborough's first marriage to the American heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt. Despite many offers of marriage, Gladys kept her independence until, aged 40, she received the invitation she could not refuse - to marry the Duke of Marlborough and, as his second wife, become the Duchess of Blenheim Palace. But it was to be unhappy, Gladys loathing the Duke, and in the end finding herself cruelly evicted from Blenheim. Her final years were spent in lonely, eccentric isolation, never losing her fiercely independent spirit.</p><p>Acclaimed royal biographer Hugo Vickers, editor of the bestselling <i>The Quest for Queen Mary</i>, knew Gladys towards the end of her life.

As <b>Bob Buford</b> and <b>Peter Drucker</b> discovered, when people share a common and compelling vision, anything can happen. </p></p><p>In 1982 a young, ambitious East Texas entrepreneur, whose business is growing at doubledigit rates, decides there must be more to life. So, oddly enough, he writes a letter to the man whose books he most treasures&#x2015;Peter F. Drucker, father of modern management theory and practice. As they met over the years, Buford sees that &#x201c;Drucker is to management what Shakespeare is to literature.&#x201d; Their relationship progresses from paid consultant to mentor to close friend. Drucker &amp; Me tells how two men discover a mutual passion and strategy that will literally change the world. Their disappointment with corporate America leads them to embrace the non-profit sector, including one of the most important developments in the last 30 years&#x2015;the mega church movement. Believing non-profit organizations change lives, they begin work with Rick Warren, Bill Hybels and others to design a new management model for non-profits in the 21st century.Bob Buford is a graduate of the University of Texas and the Owner Managed Program at the Harvard Business School. Until the sale of his company in July 1999, Bob Buford served as Chairman and CEO of Buford Television, Inc., which began with the single ABC affiliate in Tyler, Texas, and grew into a network of cable systems across the country. In 1995 Buford wrote 500,000 copy bestseller Halftime, a book about how to deal with the second half of our lives.

She lives in Ware, MA.</p>Grade 1-4-Taking particular strands from a Chinese tale of a magic brocade, detailed threads from a Norwegian story of a glass mountain, and filaments from her own artistic imagination, Sanderson has woven a new fabric, framed in a 15th-century European landscape (a time of extraordinary tapestry making). The stately text incorporates many traditional elements: the three sons of a widowed mother, the apparently feckless youngest son, magical animal aides, a crystal/glass mountain, and a quest fraught with dangers. Opulent oil paintings in lush detail reflect the turns of the story line as they parade in step with the youngest son on his desperate search for the missing tapestry that holds the fantastic landscape of his mother's dreams. And, while the phrase "happily ever after" is never uttered, delighted readers and listeners can rest assured it applies to the comforting conclusion. Match this story with Marilee Heyer's stunning The Weaving of a Dream (Puffin, 1989)-a retelling of the Chinese tale-and Claire Martin's resplendent Boots and the Glass Mountain (Dial, 1992; o.p.)-a retelling of the Norse story-and you will have both a rich visual experience and the unique opportunity to trace newly interwoven story lines to more original sources.

I fear such an army could too easily be misused for political purposes.</i></p><p>&#x2014;Sister Marie Elizabeth, first provost of the Arcanum</p><p>The wyvern-drawn prison carriage transported Stephano de Guichen and Rodrigo de Villeneuve to a makeshift wharf located only God and the Arcanum knew where. The terrain was isolated, rockbound. A yacht painted black and marked with the symbol of the Arcanum was the only boat docked at the wharf. The rain had let up and now the sun shone through gray, trailing mists. The time must be somewhere near midafternoon. Only about an hour had passed since Stephano and his friend were accosted by the monks of Saint Klee, placed under arrest, and carried off in chains.</p><p>The carriage landed. The monks ordered Stephano and Rodrigo, both still in chains, to descend, then escorted them to the black yacht.</p><p>They had been charged with heresy. They would be taken to the dungeons at the Citadel, the home of the Arcanum, the priests who enforced Church laws. The Citadel was a fortress located on a mountain surrounded by the waters of an inland sea. If anyone had escaped from the Citadel&#x2019;s dungeons, they had not lived to tell the tale.</p><p>Two monks sat in the driver&#x2019;s box of the yacht. One was the driver, operating the helm and handling the two wyverns. The other rode along as guard.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re dangerous criminals,&#x201d; Stephano remarked bitterly to Rodrigo.</p><p>His friend said nothing, might not have even heard him. Stephano regarded him with concern. Rodrigo walked with his head bowed, seemingly oblivious to what was going on around him. He wasn&#x2019;t even watching where he was going. He stumbled blindly over the uneven ground.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll prove our innocence, Rigo,&#x201d; Stephano said to him.</p><p>Rodrigo bleakly shook his head. He knew as well as Stephano that those who went into the dungeons of the Citadel never came out.</p><p>The monk who had accompanied Stephano and Rodrigo ordered them into the yacht. The entrance was located behind the driver, which meant they had to climb up on the box to make their way inside.</p><p>The driver stood to allow them to pass. Stephano hoisted himself up on the box&#x2014;not easy to do with his hands shackled. Rodrigo followed more slowly, missed his step and nearly fell. The monk caught him and assisted him through the door. Once his prisoners were safely inside, the monk entered and shut and locked the door behind him.</p><p>Stephano had been in Father Jacob&#x2019;s black yacht. It was luxurious, homey with a table, comfortable chairs, and beds. The interior of this yacht was bare, stripped down. The only furnishings were benches that had been built into the bulwarks, a table&#x2014;bolted to the deck&#x2014;a chair and several storage lockers. The portholes were covered by iron bars. This yacht was designed for prisoner transport.</p><p>The driver shouted at the wyverns, and the black yacht lifted smoothly into the air.</p><p>&#x201c;If you give me your word as gentlemen that you will not cause trouble, I will remove the manacles,&#x201d; said the monk.</p><p>Rodrigo held out his hands. Stephano was about to tell the monk to go to hell.</p><p>Rodrigo, seeing Stephano&#x2019;s obdurate expression, said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a fool. Look at your wrists.&#x201d;</p><p>Stephano looked down. His wrists were cut and rubbed raw from the manacles. And he had to admit he felt helpless without the use of his hands.</p><p>&#x201c;You have my word,&#x201d; he muttered dourly.</p><p>A blue spark sizzled from the monk&#x2019;s fingers, and the lock on the manacles clicked. The manacles popped open and fell to the floor. The monk did the same for Rodrigo, then pointed to the benches, silently indicating they were to sit there.</p><p>Stephano sat down and rubbed his wrists. Rodrigo eased himself down on the bench and lay motionless, staring up at the ceiling. He was deathly pale. Stephano rested his hand on his friend&#x2019;s shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s going to be all right, Rigo. These charges that we conspired with Father Jacob and Sir Ander are ludicrous. There&#x2019;s been some sort of mistake. We&#x2019;re innocent.&#x201d;</p><p>Stephano spoke loudly, aiming his words at the monk, who had taken a seat facing his prisoners in the yacht&#x2019;s only chair.</p><p>Rodrigo closed his eyes.</p><p>Stephano sat forward and continued his argument.</p><p>&#x201c;These charges make no sense! The idea that either Father Jacob or Sir Ander are heretics is absurd and the notion that we conspired with them against the Church is more absurd still! Sir Ander is a Knight Protector, a man of honor, a true knight, dedicated to his faith. We met him and Father Jacob at the Abbey of Saint Agnes. They were there to investigate the murders of the nuns. When the Bottom Dwellers attacked them, their yacht was damaged and we towed them to Westfirth for repairs. That&#x2019;s all there was to it.&#x201d;</p><p>The monk remained unmoving, seemingly deaf.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wasting your breath, my friend,&#x201d; Rodrigo said in a listless tone. &#x201c;The monks of Saint Klee are the guardians of the Citadel, sent to arrest us and deliver us safely to the inquisitors. They don&#x2019;t care if we are guilty or innocent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They <i>should</i> care,&#x201d; Stephano said angrily.</p><p>Rodrigo gave a wan smile and again closed his eyes. The monk sat upright in his chair, watching Stephano and Rodrigo without appearing to watch them. Stephano had heard stories about the monks of Saint Klee, the guardians of the Citadel.</p><p>Saint Klee had been a man who taught that life was sacred and that one should subdue a foe, if possible, rather than kill him. To this end, the monks of Saint Klee had, over the centuries, developed specialized magicks designed to subdue their victims. Stephano could attest to the magic&#x2019;s effectiveness. His body still tingled from the spell they had cast on him, which had left him twitching and writhing on the floor.</p><p>This monk was short, lean, and spare. He wore the traditional red robes of the monks of Saint Klee. His long curly black hair was tied in a knot at the back of his head. He spoke with an Estaran accent. The other two monks in the driver&#x2019;s box wore the same red robes. They were both built the same&#x2014;all bone and muscle and gristle. The only difference was that one had sparse graying hair and one had brown.</p><p>Stephano, feeling the need to move about, started to stand up. The monk jumped to his feet. Stephano hurriedly raised his hands to show he meant no harm.</p><p>&#x201c;I gave you my word, Brother!&#x201d; said Stephano, annoyed. &#x201c;I just want to walk around a little, stretch my legs.&#x201d;</p><p>The monk considered, then nodded and settled himself again.</p><p>Stephano paced aimlessly around the yacht&#x2019;s only room, then walked over to look out one of the iron-barred windows. He was aware of the monk&#x2019;s eyes on him the entire time and he was tempted to ask if the monk thought he was going to try to rip out the bars, smash the glass, and hurl himself to his death on the ground far below.</p><p>The yacht was flying just beneath cloud level. Below, Stephano could see a walled city and outlying homes and farm fields spread over lush hillsides. A large river meandered among the hills. By the sun&#x2019;s location, he could tell they were sailing south. There were no other walled cities in this part of the country. The city must be Eudaine, on the banks of the river Conce.</p><p>A flash of lightning followed quickly by a crack of thunder startled him; then came a deluge. Rain poured down in a gray curtain, drumming on the roof and rolling down the windowpanes. The yacht&#x2019;s interior grew dark as clouds closed in.</p><p>A lamp stood on the table. The monk apparently liked to sit in the gloom, however, because he did not light it. More thunder rumbled and the yacht rocked with the gusting wind. The storm was worsening.</p><p>Rodrigo had not moved and Stephano feared he might slip into melancholia and never come out. He needed some way to distract him, rouse him from his dark thoughts. Stephano went back to sit beside him.</p><p>&#x201c;Rigo, we need to talk,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about my mother.&#x201d;</p><p>Rodrigo opened his eyes and sat bolt upright to stare in astonishment. The subject of Stephano&#x2019;s mother was forbidden by Stephano, who disliked thinking about her, much less talking about her. He was now driven by recent events to do both.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m listening, but just remember, so is our friend,&#x201d; Rodrigo said with a glance at the monk.</p><p>Stephano gave a shrug.</p><p>&#x201c;He probably knows everything anyway. D&#x2019;argent showed me the will that states I am my mother&#x2019;s legitimate heir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; said Rodrigo. &#x201c;I saw it. What about it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe it. It&#x2019;s a fraud. To be my mother&#x2019;s heir, she and my father would have to have been married.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then that must be the case. My dear fellow, your mother&#x2019;s will was drawn up by lawyers, signed and attested with her signature and the signatures of witnesses. How could it be a fraud?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;According to my grandfather, my father never saw or communicated with my mother after I was born. He never talked about her; never uttered her name.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your grandfather must have been wrong. You have to face facts, my friend,&#x201d; said Rodrigo. &#x201c;Upon your mother&#x2019;s death&#x2014;which sad occasion we all hope will not happen for many, many years&#x2014;you will become one of the wealthiest men in Rosia, maybe in all the world. The riches of the crown are said to be nothing compared to those of your mother.&#x201d;</p><p>Stephano brushed wealth aside. &#x201c;D&#x2019;argent said that he told me about my mother&#x2019;s will on her orders, because she fears she might not return. I am worried about her, Rigo. Seems strange to say, since I have always hated her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could ask Sir Ander&#x2014;&#x201d; Rodrigo began.</p><p>&#x201c;When we see him in prison?&#x201d; Stephano said drily, forgetting that he was supposed to be keeping Rodrigo&#x2019;s mind off their current predicament.</p><p>Rodrigo paled a bit, but he rallied.</p><p>&#x201c;What I was going to say is that <i>once we are freed,</i> you can ask Sir Ander if he knows anything about your parents being married. He was a good friend to both of them.&#x201d;</p><p>Stephano thought this over. &#x201c;I think Sir Ander <i>does</i> know something. He tried to tell me back at the Abbey, but I wouldn&#x2019;t listen. I resented the fact that he was friends with my mother, and I accused him of being disloyal to my father&#x2019;s memory. But maybe&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>He was stopped in midsentence by the shrill shrieking of the wyverns. The next moment, a fiery blast hit the yacht, throwing Stephano and Rodrigo off the bench and dumping the monk out of his chair.</p><p>&#x201c;Were we struck by lightning?&#x201d; Rodrigo asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not unless lighting is green,&#x201d; said Stephano grimly. &#x201c;That was a blast of contramagic! Keep down.&#x201d;</p><p>Rodrigo flattened himself on the deck.</p><p>The monk twisted catlike to his feet. He cast Stephano a warning look.</p><p>&#x201c;Stay where you are, sir,&#x201d; the monk ordered, finally speaking. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move.&#x201d;</p><p>The monk hurried to the window. Stephano had no need to move. Looking past the monk&#x2019;s shoulder, he could see armed men riding gigantic bats flying out of the rain clouds.</p><p>&#x201c;Bottom Dwellers,&#x201d; said Stephano.</p><p>&#x201c;Dear God!&#x201d; Rodrigo groaned. &#x201c;First we&#x2019;re arrested and now demons are attacking us! Could this day <i>get</i> any worse?&#x201d;</p><p>The riders appeared to be aiming their fire at the driver. The wyverns were shrieking in terror at the sight of the giant bats, and he was having difficulty controlling them. The yacht rocked and pitched, making it hard to stand. Stephano could see at least a dozen more bats emerging from the storm clouds. He doubted if even the legendary monks of Saint Klee could fight off such numbers.</p><p>The monk remained standing in front of the window, gazing out at the bat riders, who now had the yacht surrounded. Stephano waited tensely for another attack, which likely would send the yacht plunging to the ground. But nothing happened; no more blasts.</p><p>&#x201c;They are trying to force us to land,&#x201d; Stephano said.</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Rodrigo asked in muffled tones. He lay face down on the deck with his arms covering his head. &#x201c;Why not just blow us out of the sky?&#x201d;</p><p>Stephano shook his head. He spoke to the monk&#x2019;s back. &#x201c;Do you know why, Brother?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They want the yacht,&#x201d; the monk replied. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t want to damage it. And they want to capture us alive.&#x201d;</p><p>Stephano wondered why at first and then he recalled what Father Jacob had told him, about how the demons had tortured the nuns of the Abbey of Saint Agnes before they killed them. He started to say something, glanced at Rodrigo, and was silent.</p><p>The high-pitched screams of the wyverns were growing louder and more frantic. The Bottom Dwellers, wearing demonic-looking helms, flew alongside the yacht&#x2014;a strange and hideous escort. The monk walked over to a bench and reached underneath it to draw out what appeared to be an ordinary wooden walking staff. Stephano guessed it wasn&#x2019;t ordinary and that it wasn&#x2019;t a staff. The monk returned to the window.</p><p>&#x201c;I can help you fight them, Brother,&#x201d; said Stephano. &#x201c;Give me a pistol. I know you rely on your magic, but you must have weapons stored somewhere on board.&#x201d;</p><p>The monk made no answer.</p><p>&#x201c;I gave you my word as a gentleman I won&#x2019;t try to escape,&#x201d; Stephano promised.</p><p>&#x201c;Mine, too,&#x201d; said Rodrigo from the deck. &#x201c;If you have some silk I can cover it with constructs to defend against contramagic&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rigo!&#x201d; Stephano said sharply. In a lower voice he added, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk about contramagic! You&#x2019;re in enough trouble already!&#x201d;</p><p>The monk was keeping watch out the window. He smiled faintly.</p><p>&#x201c;We also know how to defend against contramagic, Monsieur Rodrigo. Father Jacob warned us to be prepared.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then why are they charging us with heresy?&#x201d; Stephano asked angrily. &#x201c;None of this makes any sense.&#x201d;</p><p>The monks launched their own attack. Bright, fiery red light reflected off the gray clouds, then another blast of green contramagic shook the yacht. Bats screeched; the wyverns screamed. Stephano caught a glimpse of a bat and its rider tumbling out of the sky trailing smoke.</p><p>&#x201c;Please stand back, Captain,&#x201d; the monk ordered.</p><p>Placing himself directly in front of the iron-barred window, the monk raised the staff. The wood began to glow. A blast of red light streaked from the staff and struck the porthole. The glass exploded. The iron bars glowed red hot. The bat riders saw their danger, but it was too late to flee before the fiery wave hit them, immolating the two bats and their riders, consuming them in white flame.</p><p>&#x201c;Good thing we didn&#x2019;t try to escape,&#x201d; Rodrigo remarked, shuddering.</p><p>The wind gusted, sending rain rushing through the broken window. The monk glanced over his shoulder at Stephano.</p><p>&#x201c;The pistols are stored in a compartment in the bulkhead just above your head, Captain.&#x201d;</p><p>Stephano looked, but he could not see a compartment. The monk spoke a word and blue magical light illuminated the wall, revealing a secret cabinet.</p><p>&#x201c;The pistols are loaded,&#x201d; the monk continued. &#x201c;I will have to remove the warding constructs&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>A bat rider appeared outside the shattered window, and another bat rider swooped down beside him.</p><p>&#x201c;Brother, duck!&#x201d; Stephano warned.</p><p>Green fire blasted through the window. The monk cried out and reeled backward. Blood and rain streamed down his face. He staggered and Stephano caught hold of him.</p><p>&#x201c;Rigo, light the lamp!&#x201d; Stephano ordered, lowering the wounded monk to the deck. &#x201c;Bring it over here. And keep your head down!&#x201d;</p><p>Rodrigo activated the lamp&#x2019;s magic with a word. Crouching low, he brought the light to Stephano. Rodrigo took one look at the monk&#x2019;s face in the lamplight and sucked in a horrified breath.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, God!&#x201d; he whispered.</p><p>One of the monk&#x2019;s eyes had been pierced by a large, jagged splinter of wood. The other eye was dark with blood.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see!&#x201d; T...</p></p><h2>The Answer Is You</h2><p>In times of challenge and change, there are key questions that many share: Do we search for meaning, or grasp for survival?

By his own deadpan account, he was &#34;obliged to kill eight men&#34; in Grant County alone -- not counting four other outlaws he personally dropped from the scaffold. Disinclined by nature to back down from anyone, Tucker was involved in some one dozen shooting scrapes, was shot four times, and he arrested Russian Bill and Sandy King. Yet &#34;Dangerous Dan Tucker&#34; is more than a gunman&#39;s story. Author Bob Alexander skillfully weaves in Tucker&#39;s nervy confrontations with criminals, with the quirky, everyday details of an underpaid lawman living on the edge. Prodigiously researched and documented, Alexander presents a significant Western character heretofore lost to history. His Dan Tucker is no Hollywood hero, but he is extremely competent and supremely dangerous -- if you&#39;re an outlaw.</p><p>A retired Special Agent with the U.S. Treasury Department, and a former city detective, Bob Alexander is a thirty-five year law enforcement veteran. He currently teaches in the Criminal Justice program for Navarro College and is a Master certified Texas Peace Officer.

An enormously influential and original thinker, Jung was for some time Freud�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s principal disciple, but he became more and more critical of the Freudian emphasis on repressed sexual tendencies and after the publication of Symbols of Transformation in 1912, Jung broke away from Freud to develop his own technique of analytical psychology.<br><br>Jung�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s clinical work and, perhaps more importantly, his own experience of so called occult phenomena led him to formulate and describe a number of key concepts, which have now passed into general currency, including the theory of archetypes; the collective unconscious; synchronicity; and the idea of active imagination, a technique of conscious dreaming.<br><br>With characteristic fluency, Colin Wilson weaves a fascinating biographical narrative with a penetrating analysis of Jung�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s ideas, providing a clear, readable introduction to his life and work.</p><p>Colin Wilson is a renowned authority on the paranormal and is the author of over fifty books, with subjects ranging from mysticism to criminology.

His dream was the creation of the world&#39;s first Socialist state. It was a short-lived dream that became a nightmare when Stalin rose to absolute power in 1929. Lenin was the avant-garde revolutionary who adapted Marxist theory to the practical realities of a vast, complex and backward Russia. Is he chiefly to blame for opening the way to the totalitarian regime of Stalin? Readers will be able to judge for themselves. Lenin&#39;s career is depicted in this book from his obscure provincial origins to architect of the Bolshevik October Revolution, and his ideas, his genius for underground organization and strategies for agitation are explained. It is impossible to estimate the events in post-communist Russia and Eastern Europe today without some basic grasp of the Russian Revolution and Lenin&#39;s role in it. This book aims to make that history accessible and digestible.</p><p></p><h2>Friday Night Lights (gift): A Town, A Team And A Dream</h2><p>Return once again to the enduring account of life in the Mojo lane, to the Permian Panthers of Odessa--the winningest high school football team in Texas history. Odessa is not known to be a town big on dreams, but the Panthers help keep the hopes and dreams of this small, dusty town going. Socially and racially divided, its fragile economy follows the treacherous boom-bust path of the oil business. In bad times, the unemployment rate barrels out of control; in good times, its murder rate skyrockets. But every Friday night from September to December, when the Permian High School Panthers play football, this West Texas town becomes a place where dreams can come true. With frankness and compassion, Bissinger chronicles one of the Panthers&#39; dramatic seasons and shows how single-minded devotion to the team shapes the community and inspires--and sometimes shatters--the teenagers who wear the Panthers&#39; uniforms.</p><p>Secular religions are fascinating in the devotion and zealousness they breed, and in Texas, high school football has its own rabid hold over the faithful. H.G. Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, enters into the spirit of one of its most fervent shrines: Odessa, a city in decline in the desert of West Texas, where the Permian High School Panthers have managed to compile the winningest record in state annals. Indeed, as this breathtaking examination of the town, the team, its coaches, and its young players chronicles, the team, for better and for worse, <i>is</i> the town; the communal health and self-image of the latter is directly linked to the on-field success of the former. The 1988 season, the one <i>Friday Night Lights</i> recounts, was not one of the Panthers' best. The game's effect on the community--and the players--was explosive. Written with great style and passion, <i>Friday Night Lights</i> offers an American snapshot in deep focus; the picture is not always pretty, but the image is hard to forget.<b>H.G.

By the author of Jane: A Murder. 40,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Maggie Nelson</b> is the author of three books of poetry: <i>Jane: A Murder,</i> finalist for the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for the Art of the Memoir; <i>The Latest Winter;</i> and <i>Shiner,</i> finalist for the Poetry Society of America's Norma Farber First Book Award. Currently she is on the faculty of the School of Critical Studies at CalArts in Valencia, California, and lives in Los Angeles.The grisly 1969 Michigan murder of 23-year-old law student Jane Mixer is evocatively re-examined here by her niece, poet Nelson, in light of new evidence in the case. Just as Nelson was completing a book of poetry about her aunt in 2004 (<i>Jane: A Murder</i>)&#x2014;after 35 years of a closed case for which John Collins had been convicted in 1970&#x2014;new DNA evidence linked a retired, now elderly nurse, Gary Leiterman, to Mixer's murder. Nelson's intimate memoir chronicles how she and her mother, older sister Emily and grandfather managed to harness their emotional pain and "bear witness" at the Ann Arbor trial and conviction of Leiterman. Nelson's search for answers in the murder of Mixer, who hitched a ride from a stranger and was shot twice at close range, strangled, then dragged to a cemetery, dilates into excruciating details about other cases of girls missing and mutilated. Nelson's cathartic narrative encompasses closure of unrelated events in her own life, such as mourning her dead father, dealing with a recent heartache and reconciling with her once-wayward sister. Her narrative is wrenching, though readers come no closer to understanding the character of Mixer or the motive for her murder. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But lurking in the shadows is a dark element ready to snatch that peace away. Sister Rosette Christopher, an exorcist working as a part of the Magdala Order, has a duty to fight the demons which appear and cause destruction. But along with her companion Chrono, she usually ends up causing more destruction than the demons themselves! On one particular mission, they meet a young girl with a beautiful voice named Azmaria, who is being targeted by her own stepfather. As Rosette and Chrno work to save her, more is revealed about the relationship between them. There is more to these two than meets the eye.</p><p></p><h2>The Joy of Following Jesus</h2><p>The terms Christian and disciple should be synonymous. But they&#39;re not. Today, one may be regarded as a Christian even if he or she demonstrates few, if any, signs of discipleship. The message Jesus proclaimed was a call to faith with obedience. He doesn&#39;t want us to simply believe His teachings- He wants us to live them. If you are a Christian who wants to be a true disciple, The Joy of Following Jesus is for you. Beloved author J. Oswald Sanders outlines the standards and underlying principles of discipleship. Each fast-moving chapter is packed with Scripture references establishing the essential elements of a disciple&#39;s life-style. Mr. Sanders spotlights twenty of those elements, including the disciple&#39;s partnership with the Holy Spirit, commitment to prayer and spiritual health, relationship to others, and the disciple&#39;s relationship to Christ. J. Oswald Sanders says, &#34;It is one thing to master the biblical principles of discipleship, but quite another to transfer those principles into shoe leather.&#34; His insights and encouragements will challenge you to do just that. J. Oswald Sanders, who served as consulting director of Overseas Missionary Fellowship, was involved in an international preaching ministry. He received the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his devotional and theological writing. In 1992 he passed into the presence of the Jesus he loved and followed.</p><p></p><h2>The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge</h2><p>Since his first published story, "Apartness," appeared in 1965, Vernor Vinge has forged a unique and awe-inspiring career in science fiction as his work has grown and matured. He is now one of the most celebrated science fiction writers in the field , having won the field's top award, the Hugo, for each of his last two novels.<br><br>Now, for the first time, this illustrious author gathers all his short fiction into a single volume. This collection is truly the definitive Vinge, capturing his visionary ideas at their very best. It also contains a never-before-published novella, one that represents precisely what this collection encapsulates--bold, unique, challenging science fictional ideas brought to vivid life with compelling storytelling.<br><br>Including such major pieces as "The Ungoverned" and "The Blabber," this sumptuous volume will satisfy any reader who loves the sense of wonder, and the excitement of great SF.<br></p><p>A career-spanning collection of science fiction from one of the field's most highly regarded writers, <i>The Collected Stories</i> contains all of Vinge's published short fiction with the exception of two stories--almost 40 years of work including his first professional sale and his most recent novella (published here for the first time). It's a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable review of his career, made richer by the addition of forewords and afterwords to the individual stories in which he discusses everything from the ideas that drove the story to insights on his own writing process. <p> Vinge's writing is characterized by a clear love of science and an empathy for human needs and feelings. He's intensely curious about what happens when people and science collide. His stories explore the legacies of racism and xenophobia, the pros and cons of anarchy, alien contact, and the sometimes even more difficult contact between humans. He's a master of big ideas, epic settings, and stories well told. <i>--Roz Genessee</i></p>Born in Waukesha, Wisconsin and raised in Central Michigan, science fiction writer Vernor Vinge is the son of geographers.

Known for his rigorous hard-science approach to his SF, he became an iconic figure among cybernetic scientists with the publication in 1981 of his novella "True Names," which is considered a seminal, visionary work of Internet fiction.<br><br>He has also gained a great deal of attention both here and abroad for his theory of the coming machine intelligence Singularity. Sought widely as a speaker to both business and scientific groups, he lives in San Diego, California.<br></p><h2>Canoeing Michigan Rivers</h2><p>This book was conceived on a February weekend on the Pine River. That trip began and ended so inauspiciously that it has earned an honored listing in our personal archives under &#34;Chalk it up to experience.&#34; It began early Saturday morning in a search for Edgetts Bridge - lost on roads with names like 50 and 49 1/2, guided by a vague hand-drawn map and even vaguer local advice. It ended Sunday evening when we found our way back to that remote bridge and discovered that our vehicle had been broken into and ransacked. On the drive home we decided something had to be done. There had been too many trips marred by insufficient and inaccurate information. There was no such guide at the time. So, to make a long story short, we decided we would create one, and - two years and about 1,500 miles of canoeing later - this is the result.</p><p>Jerry Dennis is the author of many literary and popular works about nature, science, and outdoor recreation.

Before her own transfer, cameras mounted in the shuttle bay had shown her the long waldos maneuvering the huge cargo out of the bay into the waiting arms of the OTV--orbital transfer vehicle--as if two spiders were trading a cocoon-wrapped fly. The operation had taken an hour, and with its slow fascination had distracted her from thoughts about her present circumstances.<br>When her own turn came and she donned the passenger bubble to be guided across the ten meters to the OTV&#x2019;s lock, she worked hard to appear calm. The bubble was made of transparent plastic, so she did not suffer from claustrophobia--almost the opposite, in fact. She could feel the immensity of the blackness beyond the spacecraft, though she could not make out stars. They were outdone by the glow of the Earth and the close, brightly lighted surfaces of the OTV, a train of clustered tanks, balls and prisms wrapped in aluminum beams.<br>The three-man, two-woman crew of the OTV greeted her warmly in the narrow tunnel as she &#x201c;hatched,&#x201c; then guided her to a seat just behind theirs. From that vantage, she had a clear, direct view, and now she could see the steady pinpoints of stars.<br>So confronted, with none of the comfortable separation of a video monitor frame, space seemed to extend into a mating of infinite, star-cluttered halls. She felt as if she could walk down any one of the halls and become lost in altered perspective.<br>She still wore the black jumpsuit she had been handed in Florida just six hours before. She felt dirty. Her hair, even though tied up in a bun, let loose irritating wisps. She could smell her own nervousness.<br>The crew floated around her, making last-minute checks, punching readings into slates and processors. Patricia examined their colored suits--the women in red and blue, the men in green and black and gray--and idly wondered how they were ranked and who commanded. Everything seemed casually efficient with no deference in voice or manner, as if they were civilians. But they were not.<br>The OTV was a registered unarmed military vehicle, subject to the restrictions imposed after the Little Death. It was one of dozens of new vehicles that had been constructed in Earth orbit since the appearance of the Stone, and it differed substantially from the vehicles that had serviced the Joint Space Force&#x2019;s Orbital Defense Platforms. It was larger and capable of traveling much greater distances; by treaty, it could not carry cargoes to the ODPs.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re leaving in three minutes,&#x201c; said the shuttle&#x2019;s copilot, a blond woman whose name Patricia had already forgotten. She touched Patricia on the shoulder and smiled. &#x201c;Everything will be hectic for a half hour or so. If you need a drink or have to use the lavatory, now&#x2019;s the time.&#x201d;<br>Patrica shook her head and returned the smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good. Virgin?&#x201d;<br>Patricia stared.<br>&#x201c;First flight, she means,&#x201c; the other woman clarified. Patrica remembered her name--Rita, just like her mother.<br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201c; Patricia said. &#x201c;Would I be sitting here acting like a cow in a slaughterhouse, otherwise?&#x201d;<br>The blond laughed. The pilot--James or Jack, with beautiful green eyes--looked over his shoulder at her, his head framed by the belt and sword of Orion. &#x201c;Relax, Patricia,&#x201c; he said. So calm. She was almost intimidated by their professional assurance. They were spacefarers, originally assigned to the near-Earth orbit platforms and now working the distances between Earth, Moon and Stone. She was just a young woman fresh out of graduate school, and she had never in her life even left the state of California until traveling to Florida for the shuttle flight from Kennedy Space Center.<br>She wondered what her father and mother were doing now, sitting at home in Santa Barbara. Where did they imagine their daughter to be? She had said good-bye just a week ago. Her stomach still churned at the memory of her last few moments with Paul. His letters would get to her, that was guaranteed--forwarded through the APO address. But what could she tell him in her return messages? Very likely, nothing. And her time in space had been estimated at two months, minimum.<br>She listened to the rumble and purr of the OTV machinery. She heard fuel pumps, mystery noises, gurgles like large water bubbles popping behind the passenger cabin, then the sharp <em>tings</em>of the attitude motors driving the craft away from the shuttle.<br>They began rotating, their axis somewhere near the middle of the cocoon cargo, clamped where a spare hexagonal fuel tank would have otherwise been. The OTV lurched forward with the impulse of its first engine burn. The blond, still not in her seat, landed on her feet against the rear bulkhead, flexed her knees with the impact and finished her sequence on the processor.<br>Then everyone buckled in.<br>The second burn took place fifteen minutes later. Patricia closed her eyes, nestled into the couch and resumed work on a problem she had put aside more than two weeks before. She had never required paper during the initial stages of her work. Now, the Fraktur symbols paraded before her, separated by her own brand of sign notation, invented when she was ten years old. There was no music--she usually listened to Vivaldi or Mozart while working--but nevertheless, she became immersed in a sea of abstraction. Her hand went to the pack of music coins and the slate stereo attachment in her small effects bag.<br>A few minutes later, she opened her eyes. Everyone was in their seats, staring intently at instrument panels. She tried to nap. Briefly, before dozing off, she ran through her Big Question again:<br>Why had <em>she</em>, in particular, been chosen from a list of mathematicians that must have been meters long? That she had won a Fields Award didn&#x2019;t seem reason enough; there were other mathematicians of far greater experience and stature...<br>Hoffman hadn&#x2019;t really offered an explanation. All she had said was, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to the Stone. All that you&#x2019;ll need to know is up there, and it&#x2019;s classified, so I&#x2019;m not allowed to give you documents while you&#x2019;re here on Earth. You&#x2019;ll have a hell of a lot of studying to do. And I&#x2019;m sure it will be glorious fun for a mind like yours.&#x201d;<br>As far as Patricia knew, her expertise had no practical use whatsoever, and she preferred it that way.<br>She didn&#x2019;t doubt her talents. But the very fact that they were calling on <em>her</em>--that they might need to know about (as she had expressed it in her doctoral dissertation, <em>Non-gravity Bent Geodesics of n-Spatial Reference Frames: An Approach to Superspace Visualization and Probability Clustering</em>)--made her even more apprehensive.<br>Six years ago, a Stanford math professor had told her that the only beings who would ever fully appreciate her work would be gods or extraterrestrials.<br>In the dark, sleepily drifting away from the OTV noises and the sensation of her stomach pressing always upward, she thought of the Stone. The governments involved did not discourage speculation but provided no fuel to feed the fires. The Russians, allowed on the Stone only the last year, hinted darkly at what their researchers had seen.<br>Amateur astronomers--and a few civilian professionals who hadn&#x2019;t been visited by government agents--had pointed out the three regular latitudinal bands and the odd dimples at each pole, as if it had been turned on a lathe.<br>The upshot was, everyone knew it was big news, perhaps the biggest news of all time.<br>And so it wasn&#x2019;t incredible that Paul, putting a few odd facts together, had told her he thought she was going to the Stone. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just too far-out a mind to be going anywhere else,&#x201c; he had said.<br>Gods and extraterrestrials. Still, she managed to nap.<br>When she awoke, she saw the Stone briefly as the OTV swung around for its docking maneuver. It looked much like the pictures she had seen many times before published in newspapers and magazines--bean-shaped, about a third as wide in the middle as it was long, heavily cratered between the smoothly artificial excavated bands. Ninety-one kilometers in diameter at its widest, two hundred ninety-two kilometers long. Rock and nickel and iron and not nearly as simple as that.<br>&#x201c;Approaching south polar axis,&#x201c; the blond said, leaning around in her chair to look back at Vasquez. &#x201c;A little briefing, in case they haven&#x2019;t told you already. Blind leading the blind, honey.&#x201d; She glanced meaningfully at her shipmates. &#x201c;First, some facts and figures important to mere navigators. Note that the Stone is rotating on its long axis. That&#x2019;s nothing surprising--everyone knows that. But it&#x2019;s rotating once every seven minutes or so--&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Every six point eight two four minutes,&#x201c; James or Jack corrected.<br>&#x201c;That means,&#x201c; the blond continued, unfazed, &#x201c;that anything loose on the outer surface will fly away at a pretty good clip, so we can&#x2019;t dock there. We have to go through the pole.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s stuff inside?&#x201d; Patricia asked.<br>&#x201c;Quite a lot of stuff, if they&#x2019;re keeping everything--and everyone--we&#x2019;ve been bringing up in the past few years,&#x201c; James or Jack said.<br>&#x201c;The Stone&#x2019;s albedo matches any of a number of siliceous asteroids&#x2019;. Apparently, that&#x2019;s what it was at one time. Here&#x2019;s the south pole now,&#x201c; Rita said.<br>In the middle of the large polar crater was an indentation--judging from the scale of the Stone itself, quite tiny, no more than a kilometer deep and three or four kilometers wide.<br>The Stone&#x2019;s rotation was easily discernible. As the OTV matched course wit...</p></p><h2>Zen Poetry, The Penguin Book of</h2><p>Jointly translated by a Japanese scholar and an American poet, this collection spans 1500 years - from the early T&#39;ang dynasty to the present day - and offers Zen poetry in all its diversity: Chinese poems of enlightenment and health, poems of the Japanese masters and many &#34;haiku&#34;, the quintessential Zen art.

Fans of this sweet Cobble Street Cousins series may recall the first book,<i> In Aunt Lucy's Kitchen</i> (1999), in which Rosie, Lily, and Tess meet Michael Livingston, a young man who has a secret crush on their Aunt Lucy. Now, a year and five books later, Michael is about to become their uncle. The 10-year-old cousins (Rosie and Lily are actually sisters, not cousins; Tess is their cousin) are to be bridesmaids, and they have been asked to help plan the wedding because, as Aunt Lucy puts it, they are "best at making things fun." That's what makes the "cousins" so appealing; they are curious and creative, and they find great joy in everything they do. Artsy girls who are ready for chapter books will love the children's short, lighthearted adventures and want to follow the series into the middle grades. Halperin's illustrations, not available for review here, will more than likely be similar to those in the previous books: lovely pencil drawings with exquisite detail. <i>Lauren Peterson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

On the one hand, religious stereotypes abound, hampering a serious exploration of unfamiliar philosophies and practices. On the other hand, the popular idea that all religions lead to the same God or the same moral life fails to account for the distinctive origins and radically different teachings found across the world&#x2019;s many religions. Understanding World Religions presents religion as a complex and intriguing matrix of history, philosophy, culture, beliefs, and practices. Hexham believes that a certain degree of objectivity and critique is inherent in the study of religion, and he guides readers in responsible ways of carrying this out. Of particular importance is Hexham&#x2019;s decision to explore African religions, which have frequently been absent from major religion texts. He surveys these in addition to varieties of Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.</p></p><p>Standard introductions to academic fields, such as Anthropology, Economics, History, or Sociology bristle with debates about both facts and interpretations. Yet similar Religious Studies textbooks strenuously avoid anything that might be considered controversial. The virtue of this book is that it removes Religious Studies from the dream world of academic irrelevance into the nitty gritty world of daily life where religions play a major role in shaping social attitudes and behavior. This text helps students to understand the vital role of religion in contemporary society. Recognizing that existing textbooks structure the way course are taught, this text provides the reader with a standard overview of world religions. But rejecting the approach that sees all religions as a reflection of the values of Liberal Protestantism, Irving Hexham recognizes that uncritical descriptions fail to prepare students for the reality of events like the attacks of September 11, 2001, or the ongoing war between Buddhists and Hindus in Sri Lanka. Therefore, he combines empathic description with critical analysis. In his view, understanding precedes criticism, but this does not mean that criticism should be avoided.<p>Irving Hexham is professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary and adjunct professor of World Christianity at Liverpool Hope University. He has published twenty-seven academic books, including <em>The Concise Dictionary of Religion</em>, <em>Understanding Cults and New Religions</em>, and <em>Religion and Economic Thought</em>, plus eighty major academic articles and chapters in books, numerous popular articles, and book reviews. Recently he completed a report for the United Nations&#x2019; refugee agency on religious conflict in Africa and another for the Canadian Government&#x2019;s Department of Canadian Heritage on Religious Publications in Canada. He is listed in Who&#x2019;s Who in Canada and various scholarly directories. In 2008, he was honored at the historic Humboldt University in Berlin with a Festschrift, <em>Border Crossings: Explorations of an Interdisciplinary Historian</em> (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag).</p></p><h2>Champion of Freedom</h2><p>A biographical novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin.</p><p></p><h2>Our Man Weston</h2><p>Twin brothers Sidney and Tom Weston take summer jobs as bellboys at the Pine Grove Resort Hotel and become detectives when a series of strange events leads them to suspect that an international spy ring is in operation</p><p>Grade 6-8 The Weston twins are working at a resort hotel for the summer, and Sidney is sure that espionage is going on there.

Revelations about stars, agents, directors, doctors, politicians and smugglers encompass drug-taking, betrayals and backbiting, from bedroom to boardroom and from restaurant to set.</p><p><b>Julia Phillips </b>was the Oscar-winning producer for&nbsp;<i>Taxi Driver</i>,&nbsp;<i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Sting.</i><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Prologue<br><br>House Lights Dim Before Titles<br><br>The Sting had been nominated, two months before, in ten categories, including Cinematography, Editing, Actor, Screenplay, Director, and Best Picture. The Exorcist, which had garnered an equal number of nominations, had been released the same day, two days before Christmas. It had received an enormous amount of initial publicity; even The New York Times carried pictures of people lined up in the cold to get in.<br><br>Warners had been far too cautious in its release of The Exorcist. It had opened in only twenty-four theaters. At 90/10 deals, Leo Greenfield kept reminding us. But then, he was the guy who told us, based on the first week&#x2019;s figures, that our picture would gross maybe fifteen mil. We had opened in 220 theaters, with 70/30 deals, and kept widening the release. Warners waited a good six weeks until they went wide. But The Exorcist was only a three-week picture; the audience lost interest before it was available.<br><br>The Sting, on the other hand, had staying power. It had hung in, week after week, and it had opened in ten times the number of theaters. Not only was The Sting racking up some very impressive figures, but people had started to notice that it was an excellent movie. It certainly didn&#x2019;t send you out in the street unsure whether to hit a church or a bar, as The Exorcist did. And Warners had a crack at The Sting and turned us down.<br><br>We&#x2019;d made damn sure John Calley and Dick Shepherd came to the one screening Universal permitted us before the release of the picture. As they were walking out, I collared Calley, because I knew how much it annoyed him, and asked him how he liked the picture.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going home to slash my wrists,&#x201d; he said. Good. Supercilious motherfucker.<br><br>It would be them or us tonight at the Awards.<br><br>Michael and Tony had spent weeks aggravating over whether The Sting would win for Best Picture or not. They had practiced speeches, how they would stand up, their walks to the stage. I hadn&#x2019;t dared to contemplate the possibility of winning. I was not a big believer in the power of positive thinking, although I had gone to college with Norman Vincent Peale&#x2019;s daughter. Didn&#x2019;t wanna put a mojo on it; didn&#x2019;t wanna tempt the evil eye.<br><br>I translated all my anxiety into finding a dress. Joel Schumacher was my fashion consultant. We agreed I was a New York girl, most comfortable in black, and since so many Californians dressed in colors, that I would probably stand out. Where I got the chutzpah to think I might stand out at such a gathering I don&#x2019;t know. We traipsed from store to store and I would try something on and I would say, &#x201c;Now if I win . . .&#x201d; and then see if the dress was comfortable to walk in, and he would pull at a strap and say, &#x201c;Now, when you win . . .&#x201d; We finally settled on a black spaghetti-strap number by Halston at Giorgio&#x2019;s, a long strand of pearls, and a double feather boa made up of guinea hen and black ostrich feathers.<br><br>I was still, six months after Kate&#x2019;s birth, a little wide in the hip. Joel was adamant that I should wear beautiful black sandal-heels but I couldn&#x2019;t find any tall enough. I needed height. I ended up buying a pair of giant platform shoes from Fred Slatten. Black satin with rhinestones. They stayed hidden under the dress and they definitely gave me height. They also filled me with the quiescent fear that I might actually fall off them on global TV. A toss-up, looks or safety. The hips won out.<br><br>Trancas, California<br><br>April 2, 1974<br><br>I wake with a shudder at six thirty. The sun creates hot bounce on the sky/sea horizon. It is quite a sight, but I take this view for granted. Without pausing a moment in sincere appreciation, I automatically pop a diet pill. Bad move. Within twenty minutes, I&#x2019;m dancing around the sandy living room, neatening up. I run along the beach, take a perfunctory dip in the freezing-cold Pacific, race indoors for a brief hot shower.<br><br>When I hit the bedroom, Michael is standing on his head, yoga-style, in the corner of the room. &#x201c;I gotta pick up my tuxedo,&#x201d; Michael says, still upside down. The veins in his temples explode and contract on each syllable. Upstairs, I hear Kate&#x2019;s first baby-musings for the day. Sonya heats formula in the kitchen. I can smell it. I don&#x2019;t know how Kate can stand that shit.<br><br>&#x201c;Good, that&#x2019;ll give me time to be nervous all by myself. Maybe Sonya could take Kate out for a while.&#x201d; As in: I. NEED. MY. SPACE . . . <br><br>Within the hour, they&#x2019;re toast. I lay out some coke on a small mirror. Secret stash. Mine. Michael doesn&#x2019;t even know I have it . . . that&#x2019;s how it&#x2019;s gotten. I chop it lightly with a razor. It falls apart like butter. This is good coke. Smooth. I do a hit, then another. I roll a joint and smoke it out on the deck. Less than a hundred yards from me, the ocean beats down in heavy waves against the sand. I pace, my heart beating in triple time to the waves.<br><br>I watch the postal van ease its way toward our mailbox, and I vault over the deck and scramble down the hill to meet it. The mailman has a stack, bills mostly, junk mail addressed to Occupant. Sandwiched between the telephone bill and the latest issue of Time is a small blue envelope. The handwriting addressing Michael and Julia Phillips is familiar. I tear open the envelope as I return to the house, yelling &#x201c;Thanks&#x201d; over my shoulder to the mailman&#x2019;s wishes for our good luck that night. The letter is short and pithy, my favorites:<br><br>Dear Michael &amp; Julia:<br><br>In a few days, you will be getting cards and letters and telegrams from everyone, so I wanted to get in what I had to say now. The important thing to remember is that you are nice sweet people. You are about to have a lot of temptation thrown your way, so try not to forget that.<br><br>Love, John<br><br>Maybe too pithy. The letter upsets me; just now, Michael and I are nice sweet people to everybody but each other. Marriage . . . Here today, gone today. I pop half a Valium and look at my shaking hands. Shut up, I tell them.<br><br>When they do, I set about the arduous process of blow-drying my hair, then spicing it up with a curling iron. I swallow another three Valium halves and recurl my hair as a chaser each time until it is time to get dressed. After I&#x2019;m dressed, I have a little coke as a chaser for all that Val out of my secret stash. I don&#x2019;t offer Michael any. It would provoke a fight. I&#x2019;m not into fighting with Michael tonight.<br><br>Universal has been kind enough to provide a limousine for us and Tony and Antoinette Bill, and David Ward and his wife, Chris. When I first met Antoinette Bill, everybody called her Mrs. Tony. Her given name was Antoinette, but she had gone under the name Toni all her life. Tony, who was in actual fact n� Gerard Anthony Bill, was also called Tony. Somehow, Tony stayed and Toni became Mrs. Tony. I, of course, was outraged.<br><br>&#x201c;You sound like his chattel,&#x201d; I told her at lunch at Ma Maison one day. I had just had my lip and legs painfully waxed by Charlotte at Elizabeth Arden&#x2019;s, which was making me bristle. The fact that Patrick had the restaurant wrapped in polyethylene, something my father participated in inventing, and that it was a hot day with too little air conditioning, might also have added to my dyspeptic world-view. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there something else I can call you?&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled. &#x201c;Well, my real name is Antoinette, but I always thought it was pretentious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe when you were ten, but you&#x2019;re a grown-up married lady now with two kids and a husband named Gerard who likes to be called Tony, not that I blame him. I&#x2019;m gonna call you Antoinette from now on. Okay?&#x201d; I still asked permission in certain matters . . . <br><br>She grinned and flushed. &#x201c;Why not? What the hell!&#x201d; She laughed and toasted me with a glass of dry white wine.<br><br>I started calling her Antoinette; pretty soon some other people started calling her Antoinette; after a while everyone but Tony called her Antoinette. One day she went out and had her checks, credit cards, license, passport&#x2014;everything identifying her&#x2014;changed to Antoinette Bill. I felt as good that day as I did the day Michael&#x2019;s mother, Sherry, started getting paid for finding the dresses that Michael&#x2019;s father, Larry, knocked off in his lower-priced dress line. I was a fucking one-woman consciousness-raising session . . . <br><br>Michael and I have to be the first to leave because we&#x2019;re in Trancas, which is as far away from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion as you can be and still live in the county of L.A. David and Chris live in Topanga Canyon, so we pick them up on the way into town. There is something very silly about being all duded up at three o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, sitting in the back of a stretch limo, but the door will be closed, the Academy has reminded us in numerous missives preceding the event, at six thirty promptly.<br><br>We have already split up Bill/Phillips Productions and there&#x2019;s bad blood between Tony and us. This isn&#x2019;t to become known until we are. Tony decides to drive himself and meet us there. He doesn&#x2019;t want to be Hollywood and arrive in a limo. If you really feel that way, I think, why go at all? Because we&#x2019;re going to win. This concept makes me as nervous as the thought of losing.<br><br>A limo provided by the studio for the producers and the writer is a truly grandiose gesture, given all previous behavior by Universal. Basically we have been treated as a nasty inconvenience to be just barely tolerated. By Zanuck and Brown. By George Roy Hill. Mostly by those who live in the Black Tower, sometimes referred to locally as the Black Mariah, the reflector-sunglass mausoleum that houses all the Universal Executives, both living and dead. To them, our youth, so chic at some of the other studios, is an impudence.<br><br>The day the nominations came out, and both those who had made American Graffiti and The Sting, a ubiquitously young group, had snagged an incredible number of honors for Universal, we received telegrams from the top two execs at Universal: Lew Wasserman and Sid Sheinberg.<br><br>SINCEREST CONGRATULATIONS AND BEST WISHES FROM ALL OF US AT UNIVERSAL FOR TEN ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS, INCLUDING BEST PICTURE, FOR THE STING. LEW R. WASSERMAN<br><br>Not warm, but essentially correct.<br><br>CONGRATULATIONS FOR THE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATION FOR AMERICAN GRAFFITI. THE FILM IN OUR JUDGEMENT IS AN AMERICAN CLASSIC AND DESERVING OF ALL OF ITS ACCOLADES. LET&#x2019;S HOPE THERE ARE OTHER VENTURES THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE. SID SHEINBERG<br><br>Not warm, and incorrect in all its essentials.<br><br>I have this image of Sid&#x2019;s secretary: Well, all young people look alike, don&#x2019;t they? I&#x2019;ve always wondered if the message Western Unioned to George Lucas congratulated him on the receipt of so many nominations for The Sting. I wonder if he kept his, too . . . <br><br>And now, here we are: Chris and David and Michael and Julia, flying along the Pacific Coast Highway, compliments of Universal Airlines, to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. I have nibbled another half a Valium at the Wards&#x2019;. I&#x2019;ve decided it&#x2019;s okay to carry Valium to the Academy Awards. Most of the people in the Academy are from the Valium-and-Alcohol Generation. I&#x2019;m becoming a tad too relaxed behind it, though. Sleepy might be a better word.<br><br>Need a little hit, I think, as my head lolls around on my neck. Need a big hit, I amend. You have a big hit. The Sting . . . Not that kind of a hit . . . maybe coffee. If nothing else was around. I&#x2019;m pissed at myself for leaving my secret stash behind. I focus on getting downtown, like that&#x2019;s going to make the drive quicker.<br><br>By the time we reach the exit to the Music Center, limousines are backed up onto the ramp. Behind us they stack up quickly. Limos to the left of me, limos to the right. A limo! A limo! My kingdom for a limo! It is a boiling-hot day and all the air conditioners are blasting. The hot and the cold mingles with the poisonous air; the exhaust makes a greenish brown cloud that hangs over us. I feel I am in line for the funeral of the most popular guy in Hollywood. Who could that be, I wonder . . . <br><br>The limousines, the cloud, the heat, make me think: We are all going to die. A thought I have two, maybe three hundred times a day anyway. I concentrate on Life and it makes me realize I have to pee semi-badly. At the rate we&#x2019;re moving, I won&#x2019;t get to check my makeup. I know the only part of my face that is glowing with health right now is my shiny forehead.<br><br>It&#x2019;s ridiculous to worry about how I look. There&#x2019;s a long red carpet; it is the only route to the door. The door that closes promptly at six thirty! There are barricades and cops and fans and photographers. Everywhere. We do not rate a flicker. There is nothing quite like being the only unknown in a bevy of luminaries. Unless it is to be the only name at a gathering of nobodies. If I had to vote for the lesser of two evils, as I do for my president, I&#x2019;d go with anonymity. But I didn&#x2019;t know that then.<br><br>We walk along that red carpet, graced by Sally Kellerman in front of us and Paul and Linda McCartney behind us. Nobody reaches out to us. No Army Archerd interview. No hail-fellow-well-met interchange with milling celebs. An all-time Humbler. A year or two before, I&#x2019;d have been amazed to be here. Now that I am, I can see that the only way to attend one of these events is as a star. We traverse the gauntlet in that casual way that says: I don&#x2019;t care to be noticed. I feel like a walk-on in a high-school play.<br><br>Of course, Tony and Antoinette are here already. We see Tony chatting up Steve Shagan, who&#x2019;s in competition with David Ward for Best Screenplay, and drinking, from the look around his mouth, his third glass of wine. He looks pretty cool in his tux. He looks like he belongs. Shagan insincerely wishes us luck. That&#x2019;s okay, I forgive him. He&#x2019;s insisted we hire Norman Garey, who acts as our lawyer and is truly our friend. I shift back and forth, no small feat on platforms four inches from the ground in the toe and probably six in the heel. It gives me the illusion that I am taking steps, presumably away, from a situation that makes me uncomfortable.</p><h2>Ba Gua: Hidden Knowledge in the Taoist Internal Martial Art</h2><p>The Taoist yogic discipline of Ba Gua is an internal form of the ancient art of kung fu--as are the much older t&#39;ai chi and Xing I. Ba Gua is the most arcane and yogic of three sister arts--t&#39;ai chi and Xing I are the others--and is distinguished by serpentine turning and circling momvements and its own internal energy exercises, Ba Gua Qi Gong.</p><p>Liu Xing-Han, of Beijing, China, is the last of the fourth-generation Ba Gua disciples. He began his martial arts studies in 1917. In 1996 he was the subject of a China National Television documentary commemorating his life's work, and has been written about in Chinese magazines, martial art journals, and newspapers. In the United States several issues of<i> Pa Kua Journal</i>, including its debut edition, covered his work. He is the author of three books on Ba Gua in China. He continues to teach the internal tradition.<br><br>John Bracy became a fifth-generation lineaged disciple of Ba Gua Zhang in 1988. He founded the Hsing Chen School of Internal Martial Arts in Costa Mesa, California in 1976 and has continued as a director since it incorporated in 1990/ He has studied at advanced levels in the United States, Taiwan, mainland China and has attained advanced rankings and honors in several styles of traditional kung fu. As a graduate exchange student in Taiwan, he researched psychotheraputic applications of acupuncture."Authentic, well-ordered and written, Bracy and Liu's<i> Ba Gua</i> should fill a void.

It shows Michigan&#x2019;s athletic department endangering the very traditions that distinguish the college game from all others. And it re-creates the euphoria of the Northwestern Wildcats winning their first bowl game in decades. Most unforgettably, <i>Fourth and Long</i> finds what the national media missed in the ugly aftermath of Penn State&#x2019;s tragic scandal: the unheralded story of players who joined forces with Coach Bill O&#x2019;Brien to save the university&#x2019;s treasured program&#x2014;and with it, a piece of the game&#x2019;s soul.<br> <br>This is the work of a writer in love with an old game&#x2014;a game he sees at the precipice.

Mike Zordich grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, on the Pennsylvania border, equidistance from Pittsburgh and Cleveland.<br> <br>Their fathers both played football for Penn State and went on to play in the NFL. Their dads revered Joe Paterno, as most of Paterno&#x2019;s players did. When Mike Mauti was born, in 1990, his dad, Rich, wrote a letter to Paterno, saying his only regret was that his son would never get the chance to play for the legendary coach.<br> <br>Seventeen years later, in 2007, Mike Mauti made his official recruiting visit to the office of Penn State&#x2019;s head coach. But minutes before he did, he met another recruit outside the indoor practice facility: Mike Zordich, who&#x2019;d already committed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never forget it,&#x201d; Mauti said. &#x201c;The first words out of his mouth are &#x2018;So are you coming or what?&#x2019; I&#x2019;m thinking, &#x2018;You know what? He&#x2019;s right.&#x2019; But I didn&#x2019;t say anything to him or my dad. I wasn&#x2019;t planning to commit on that trip.&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course, Mauti came to Penn State, and the two became inseparable.<br> <br>That friendship would be tested&#x2014;and not by each other, but by the extraordinary circumstances they would face during their years at Penn State. For these two, the moment of truth would arrive in late July 2012.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>By 10:00 a.m. Monday morning, July 23, Penn State&#x2019;s football players had finished their workout, showered, and gathered in the players&#x2019; lounge to watch NCAA president Mark Emmert&#x2019;s press conference, which was covered by virtually every news outlet in the country.<br> <br>In a statement the players would long remember, Emmert said, &#x201c;No price the NCAA can levy will repair the grievous damage inflicted by Jerry Sandusky on his victims. However, we can make clear that the culture, actions, and inactions that allowed them to be victimized will not be tolerated in collegiate athletics.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emmert then laid out a series of penalties. One erased a wide swath of Penn State&#x2019;s rich history, vacating all victories from 1998 through 2011&#x2014;thereby dropping Coach Paterno from the perch of his profession, with 409 wins, down to fifth, with 298. The sanctions also threatened Penn State&#x2019;s future: a $60 million fine, a four-year postseason ban, and a drastic reduction in the number of scholarships the football coaches could offer recruits, from twenty-five down to fifteen a year, with a maximum of sixty-five&#x2014;twenty fewer than Penn State&#x2019;s rivals could give out.<br> <br>Emmert declared Penn State&#x2019;s penalties might be considered &#x201c;greater than any other seen in NCAA history.&#x201d; Most experts believed they were second only to the infamous &#x201c;death penalty&#x201d; delivered to Southern Methodist University, from which the Mustangs had still not fully recovered twenty-six years later.<br> <br>&#x201c;Football,&#x201d; Emmert concluded, &#x201c;will never again be placed ahead of educating, nurturing, and protecting young people.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eight months earlier, on November 5, 2011, prosecutors had arrested Penn State&#x2019;s former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky on forty criminal counts, including the sexual assault of eight boys over a fifteen-year period, one of them in the showers of Penn State&#x2019;s football building. That put in motion a series of events that few could have imagined: it exposed the worst scandal in the history of modern sports; it led to the midseason firing of the iconic Joe Paterno; it prompted the hiring of little-known New England Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O&#x2019;Brien; it resulted in Penn State&#x2019;s commissioning the Freeh Report, which concluded university leaders knew enough about what Sandusky had done, but cared more about protecting the university&#x2019;s image than his young victims; and it surely accelerated Paterno&#x2019;s decline and death&#x2014;all within three months of Sandusky&#x2019;s arrest.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Those facts you probably know. What happened behind those headlines, you probably don&#x2019;t.<br> <br>The players, coaches, and staffers in Penn State&#x2019;s players&#x2019; lounge that Monday morning understood immediately that another provision of the NCAA&#x2019;s sanctions, which got far less attention outside that room at the time, threatened Penn State&#x2019;s season opener, just six weeks away: the one that allowed other schools to recruit Penn State&#x2019;s current players, who would be permitted to play for another team that fall without having to sit out a season for transferring. In practice, Emmert had declared open season for opposing coaches to cannibalize Penn State&#x2019;s roster, and all but encouraged Penn State&#x2019;s players to jump.<br> <br>Just minutes after news of the sanctions broke, recalled Mauti, who had already defied the odds by reclaiming his starting position after missing the 2009 season when he tore the ACL in his right knee, and most of the 2011 season when he tore the ACL in his left knee, &#x201c;Our phones were ringing&#x2014;blowing up&#x2014;with ten or twenty coaches calling right off. My high school coach had to turn his phone off because he got forty calls that day asking if I wanted to jump.&#x201d;<br> <br>Just a couple hours later, while Mauti met with rookie head coach Bill O&#x2019;Brien to address Mauti&#x2019;s fear that the program was on the verge of collapse, University of Southern California assistant coach Ed Orgeron called Mauti. &#x201c;His kid went to my high school, so I picked up,&#x201d; Mauti recalled. &#x201c;He asks me, &#x2018;What kind of guy is your tailback?&#x2019; The coach didn&#x2019;t even know Silas Redd&#x2019;s name. Are you serious?&#x201d;<br> <br>Apparently serious enough to fly Redd&#x2014;who ran for over a thousand yards in his sophomore year&#x2014;out to LA, where USC had Snoop Dogg pick him up at the airport in a limousine. Everyone in Penn State&#x2019;s players&#x2019; lounge assumed if the popular and talented Redd left State College, the floodgates would open.<br> <br>That fear was well-founded. That same day, recalled starting senior defensive end Pete Massaro, an Academic All-American econ major, &#x201c;One kid was telling me he was going and started listing a ton of guys in the freshmen and sophomore classes who were going to leave, too. I was freaking out. Next thing he said to me was &#x2018;Penn State football is dead.&#x2019;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought it was the end of Penn State football.&#x201d;<br> <br>So did Mauti and Zordich. As was often the case, they had the same reaction at the same time: this will not happen on my watch.<br> <br>After barely sleeping that night, they got up the next morning, Tuesday, July 24, at six. They immediately headed for strength coach Craig Fitzgerald&#x2019;s office to meet with him and Coach O&#x2019;Brien, who didn&#x2019;t need to be persuaded about the gravity of their situation.<br> <br>The seniors compiled a list of people they&#x2019;d heard were planning to leave, and together they concocted a plan they hoped would stop the exodus before it started.<br> <br>Before they split up that Tuesday morning, however, O&#x2019;Brien moved to make a major decision.<br> <br>&#x201c;Coach was saying, &#x2018;We need to make a hard deadline,&#x2019; &#x201d; Zordich recalled. &#x201c; &#x2018;This can&#x2019;t go on forever. So I&#x2019;m going to tell them, by August first, you&#x2019;re either with us or you&#x2019;re not.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>It made perfect sense. Not knowing which players would still be on the team for the first game, just six weeks away, would make it almost impossible to conduct an effective practice and could be enough to make an already fragile team fall apart, piece by piece.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking, August first?&#x201d; Zordich recalled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one week. This dude&#x2019;s got balls.&#x201d; Zordich soon proved he had some, too. After initially agreeing, the more they talked about it, the more compelled he felt to speak up.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s a good idea,&#x201d; he finally said. &#x201c;The players here don&#x2019;t know you well enough yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>As soon as Zordich said it, Mauti decided he was right, and they explained why. Their reasons were both positive and negative: they believed the more the players got to know O&#x2019;Brien and his program&#x2014;which they viewed as a long-overdue step into the future, instead of relying endlessly on Penn State&#x2019;s glorious past&#x2014;the more likely the players would be to stay; and second, if O&#x2019;Brien threatened them with a deadline, it might create a panicked rush to the doors.<br> <br>&#x201c;You say, &#x2018;Now or never,&#x2019; &#x201d; Zordich said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re going to lose a lot of guys. They&#x2019;ll get scared.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And make an irrational decision,&#x201d; Mauti added, finishing his best friend&#x2019;s sentence once again. &#x201c;If we&#x2019;ve got a deadline, word&#x2019;s going to get out to the coaches, and their phones are gonna blow up all over again the night before the deadline.&#x201d;<br> <br>At that moment, Zordich and Mauti might have been the only college football players in the country with the temerity to question the decision of their head coach&#x2014;a coach they already respected greatly&#x2014;to his face.<br> <br>At the next moment, O&#x2019;Brien might have been the only college football coach in the country willing to listen.<br> <br>O&#x2019;Brien looked at Zordich, Mauti, and Fitzgerald, and then back to Zordich, thinking and weighing the options.<br> <br>No one in that office had time to ponder the irony.<br> <br>The NCAA sanctions were encouraging &#x201c;student-athletes&#x201d; to behave like athlete-students. They were putting the lie to the NCAA&#x2019;s own propaganda, which officially discouraged transfers because &#x201c;student-athletes&#x201d; are supposed to pick their schools for the education, not the athletic opportunities. But there Emmert was, inviting Penn State&#x2019;s student-athletes to jettison the university that graduated 91 percent of its student-athletes&#x2014;a big reason many of them chose Penn State in the first place&#x2014;to transfer penalty-free for bowl-eligible football programs.<br> <br>Not only did it suddenly fall to O&#x2019;Brien, Mauti, Zordich, and every Penn State player who stayed to protect their storied program from disintegrating, they could only do so by upholding the very values the NCAA itself could apparently no longer proclaim with a straight face.<br> OHIO STATE<p></p> <br>In the early-morning hours of December 6, 2009, just a few hours after his undefeated Florida Gators lost the Southeastern Conference title game to eventual national champion Alabama, head coach Urban Meyer woke up, grabbed his chest, and collapsed.<br> <br>His wife, Shelley, who&#x2019;d been concerned about his health since he took the Florida job in 2005, didn&#x2019;t need to be convinced to call 911. An ambulance rushed to take Meyer to the hospital. Doctors determined it wasn&#x2019;t a heart attack he&#x2019;d suffered, but they still couldn&#x2019;t pinpoint the problem.<br> <br>The day after Christmas that year, Meyer announced he had &#x201c;ignored my health for years&#x201d; and would retire as Florida&#x2019;s coach after their Sugar Bowl game against his alma mater, Cincinnati.<br> <br>The Ohio native ultimately decided to take a leave of absence for a few months, before returning to lead the Gators the next season to a disappointing 8-5 record. After Florida beat Penn State, 37&#x2013;24, in the January 1, 2011, Outback Bowl, Meyer again announced his retirement, citing the same reasons he had the year before.<br> <br>Thus, at the height of his powers, Urban Meyer did what few men in his profession would even consider: he left the game for the TV booth, where he spent the 2011 season critiquing other teams.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>The same fall Meyer spent emerging from his living hell, the Ohio State Buckeyes spent entering theirs.<br> <br>The Buckeyes&#x2019; troubles paled next to Penn State&#x2019;s, but before the police arrested Sandusky, they were considered big news.<br> <br>In December of 2010, a few weeks before Ohio State&#x2019;s Sugar Bowl game, five Ohio State players were forced to admit they&#x2019;d sold some jerseys, mementos, and trophies to a tattoo-parlor owner. Predictably, he put them on eBay, and there&#x2019;s your scandal. Compared to the money USC boosters gave to Reggie Bush, and Mississippi State boosters gave to Cam Newton&#x2019;s father&#x2014;all in the six figures&#x2014;&#x201c;Tat-gate&#x201d; seemed pretty petty to most people, but to Mark Emmert and his staff, it was serious business.<br> <br>In fairness to the NCAA, as Bo Schembechler himself once said, &#x201c;Every single one of those rules came up because some coach was finding a way around them.&#x201d; This familiar cat-and-mouse game goes back to the inception of the NCAA itself&#x2014;really, why it was founded&#x2014;and even deeper, to one of the less appealing aspects of the American character.<br> <br>&#x201c;In his 1927 autobiography,&#x201d; sportswriter John Kryk writes, &#x201c;[Amos Alonzo] Stagg perhaps wrote more than he realized when he contrasted the difference between the British and Americans in the matter of rules compliance. &#x2018;The British, in general, regard both the letter and the spirit,&#x2019; Stagg wrote. &#x2018;We, in general, regard the letter only. Our prevailing viewpoint might be expressed something like this: Here are rules made and provided for. They affect each side alike. If we are smart enough to detect a joker or a loophole first, then we are entitled not only in law but in ethics to take advantage of it.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>And that&#x2019;s why the NCAA was born: to close those loopholes.<br> <br>Ohio State had told the players the rules&#x2014;although the players initially claimed the university hadn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Yet, after Ohio State submitted its own report to the NCAA on December 19, 2010, the NCAA took all of four days to determine that five players would receive a five-game suspension&#x2014;then allowed them to delay their punishment until the following fall, so they could play in the much-anticipated Sugar Bowl against eighth-ranked Arkansas on January 4, 2011.<br> <br>The Buckeyes beat the Razorbacks, 31&#x2013;26.<br> <br>It soon surfaced, however, that star quarterback Terrelle Pryor had also traded a sportsmanship award from the 2008 Fiesta Bowl, a Big Ten title ring, and&#x2014;most blasphemous to Buckeye backers&#x2014;one of his gold pants charms, which Ohio State coaches and players have been given each time they beat the pants off Michigan, dating back to 1934. None of these discoveries increased the NCAA&#x2019;s penalties, but they did cause Buckeye fans to shake their heads in wonder at such disregard for their vaunted tradition.<br> <br>Still, the whole thing seemed like a hill of beans until the spring of 2011, when head coach Jim Tressel got dragged into the investigation.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Ohio State&#x2019;s Jim Tressel era started on January 18, 2001, at a basketball game against Michigan. That night, when they introduced Tressel as Ohio State&#x2019;s new football coach at halftime, the Ohio native knew exactly what the fans wanted to hear.<br> <br>He was hired on the heels of John Cooper, whose record at Ohio State was second only to that of Woody Hayes. But Cooper&#x2019;s teams lost to Michigan an inexcusable ten times in thirteen years&#x2014;and in Columbus, you simply cannot do that. And you can&#x2019;t say the Michigan&#x2013;Ohio State rivalry is &#x201c;just another game,&#x201d; either&#x2014;which might have been a bigger sin.<br> <br>Knowing all this, Tressel wisely told the crowd, &#x201c;I can assure you that you will be proud of your young people in the classroom, in the community, and most especially in 310 days in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on the football field.&#x201d;<br> <br>The place exploded. At last, somebody gets it!<br> <br>Tressel got it&#x2014;and he proved it, beating Michigan nine out of ten times, including a record seven in a row. He also set Ohio State records for winning percentage in the modern era at .810, tied Woody Hayes&#x2019;s mark of six straight Big Ten titles, and won a national title in 2002&#x2014;only the Big Ten&#x2019;s second since 1968.<br> <br>Jim Tressel was clearly one heck of a coach. He was also pleasantly professorial&#x2014;famed for his sweater vest, not his temper&#x2014;and a great ambassador for the school.<br> <br>But smoke always seemed to billow up behind him.

But Thatcher's government is destroying working-class communities across Britain, and the post-war certainties of full employment, educational opportunity and a welfare state are gone. When his badly handicapped younger brother dies the family bonds start to weaken, his life flips out of control, and he succumbs to the defeatism and the heroin which has taken hold in Edinburgh's grimmer areas. <br>&nbsp;<br>His friends face similar challenges. Spud Murphy is paid off from his job and faces long-term unemployment, while Tommy Lawrence feels that only love can save him from being sucked into a life of petty crime and violence -- exemplified respectively by the thieving Matty Connell and psychotic Franco Begbie. And then there is Sick Boy, the supreme manipulator of the opposite sex, scamming and hustling his way through life. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Skagboys</b><i> </i>charts their journey from likely lads to young men addicted to the heroin which has flooded their disintegrating community. This is the 1980s: not the sanitized version, of upbeat pop music, mullets, shoulder-pads and MTV, but a time of drugs, poverty, AIDS, violence, political strife and hatred -- and maybe just a little love; a decade which changed Britain for ever.

But Briony&#x2019;s incomplete grasp of adult motives and her precocious imagination bring about a crime that will change all their lives, a crime whose repercussions<i> Atonement</i> follows through the chaos and carnage of World War II and into the close of the twentieth century.</p><p>Ian McEwan's Booker Prize-nominated <i>Atonement</i> is his first novel since <i>Amsterdam</i> took home the prize in 1998. But while <i>Amsterdam</i> was a slim, sleek piece, <i>Atonement</i> is a more sturdy, more ambitious work, allowing McEwan more room to play, think, and experiment.<p> We meet 13-year-old Briony Tallis in the summer of 1935, as she attempts to stage a production of her new drama "The Trials of Arabella" to welcome home her older, idolized brother Leon. But she soon discovers that her cousins, the glamorous Lola and the twin boys Jackson and Pierrot, aren't up to the task, and directorial ambitions are abandoned as more interesting prospects of preoccupation come onto the scene. The charlady's son, Robbie Turner, appears to be forcing Briony's sister Cecilia to strip in the fountain and sends her obscene letters; Leon has brought home a dim chocolate magnate keen for a war to promote his new "Army Ammo" chocolate bar; and upstairs, Briony's migraine-stricken mother Emily keeps tabs on the house from her bed. Soon, secrets emerge that change the lives of everyone present....</p><p> The interwar, upper-middle-class setting of the book's long, masterfully sustained opening section might recall Virginia Woolf or Henry Green, but as we move forward--eventually to the turn of the 21st century--the novel's central concerns emerge, and McEwan's voice becomes clear, even personal. For at heart, <i>Atonement</i> is about the pleasures, pains, and dangers of writing, and perhaps even more, about the challenge of controlling what readers make of your writing. McEwan shouldn't have any doubts about readers of <i>Atonement</i>: this is a thoughtful, provocative, and at times moving book that will have readers applauding. <i>--Alan Stewart, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>On the hottest day of the summer of 1935, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis sees her older sister Cecilia strip off her clothes and plunge into the fountain in the garden of their country house. Watching Cecilia is their housekeeper's son Robbie Turner, a childhood friend who, along with Briony's sister, has recently graduated from Cambridge. <br>By the end of that day the lives of all three will have been changed forever. Robbie and Cecilia will have crossed a boundary they had never before dared to approach and will have become victims of the younger girl's scheming imagination. And Briony will have committed a dreadful crime, the guilt for which will color her entire life. <br>In each of his novels Ian McEwan has brilliantly drawn his reader into the intimate lives and situations of his characters. But never before has he worked with so large a canvas: In "Atonement he takes the reader from a manor house in England in 1935 to the retreat from Dunkirk in 1941; from the London's World War II military hospitals to a reunion of the Tallis clan in 1999. <br>"Atonement is Ian McEwan's finest achievement. Brilliant and utterly enthralling in its depiction of childhood, love and war, England and class, the novel is at its center a profound-and profoundly moving-exploration of shame and forgiveness and the difficulty of absolution.</p><h2>The Owner Builder&#39;s Guide to Stone Masonry</h2><p>Builders Guide to stone masonry</p><p></p><h2>A Book of Migrations: Some Passages in Ireland</h2><p>In this acclaimed exploration of the culture of others, Rebecca Solnit travels through Ireland, the land of her long-forgotten maternal ancestors. <i>A Book of Migrations</i> portrays in microcosm a history made of great human tides of invasion, colonization, emigration, nomadism and tourism.

In his first nonfiction book, mystery writer Bonansinga (<i>The Black Mariah</i>, etc.) captures the raw emotion in a story full of greed, courage and overwhelming grief. The victims were looking forward to a day of eating, drinking and dancing. Dressed in their finest, the passengers swarmed onto the boat. Gazing at the huge, sturdy looking, freshly painted vessel, most took it on faith that they were in good hands. Unbeknownst to them, the <i>Eastland</i> had been beset by serious problems from its launch. The ship was hard to control and prone to listing even under normal conditions, though its various owners had covered up this fact. As the disaster unfolded, the best and worst of human nature was immediately on display. Men shoved women and children out of the way in desperate attempts to escape. From shore, passersby risked their lives to save the fortunate few. In pure Chicago style, the disaster's aftermath was marked by political infighting and petty corruption. For all the loss of life and the implications to public safely, this incident is little known today; Bonansinga's powerful book returns it to the record.

Is it to pass time? To learn something new? To escape from reality? For Will Schwalbe, reading is a way to entertain himself but also to make sense of the world, to become a better person, and to find the answers to the big (and small) questions about how to live his life. In this delightful celebration of reading, Schwalbe invites us along on his quest for books that speak to the specific challenges of living in our modern world, with all its noise and distractions. In each chapter, he discusses a particular book&#x2014;what brought him to it (or vice versa), the people in his life he associates with it, and how it became a part of his understanding of himself in the world. &nbsp;These books span centuries and genres (from classic works of adult and children&#x2019;s literature to contemporary thrillers and even cookbooks), and each one relates to the questions and concerns we all share. Throughout, Schwalbe focuses on the way certain books can help us honor those we&#x2019;ve loved and lost, and also figure out how to live each day more fully.

I call it the Reader&#x2019;s Nightmare.&nbsp;<br><br> I&#x2019;m in a busy airport, and they&#x2019;ve announced my flight. There is an epic walk to the gate, and I know I have only a few minutes before they will close the door to the jetway and my plane will leave without me. Suddenly, I realize that I don&#x2019;t have a book to read on the flight. Not one single book. I spin around, my eyes searching frantically for a bookstore. I see none. I run through the airport, past the duty-free counters selling liquor and perfume, past the luggage stores and fashion boutiques, past the place that offers neck massage. Still, I can&#x2019;t find an airport bookstore. Now, over the loudspeakers, comes the final call for my flight. &#x201c;Flight ninety-seven to Perth is ready for departure. All passengers must be on board at this time.&#x201d; They even call me by name. Panic sets in as I realize that I am almost certainly going to miss my flight. But the idea of hours on a plane without a book? Intolerable. So I run and run, searching for that bookstore&#x2014;or at least a newsstand with a rack of paperbacks. I can&#x2019;t find a single book anywhere in the airport. I start to scream.&nbsp;<br><br> Then I wake up.&nbsp;<br><br> I don&#x2019;t have this dream about food or television or movies or music. My unconscious is largely untroubled by the idea of spending hours in a metal tube hurtling through the sky without something to eat or a program to watch or tunes in my ears. It&#x2019;s the thought of being bookless for hours that jolts me awake in a cold sweat.&nbsp;<br><br> Throughout my life I&#x2019;ve looked to books for all sorts of reasons: to comfort me, to amuse me, to distract me, and to educate me. But just because you know that you can find anything you need in a book doesn&#x2019;t mean you can easily find your way to the right book at the right time, the one that tells you what you need to know or feel when you need to know or feel it.&nbsp;<br><br> A few years ago, I wrote a book about the books I read with my mother when she was dying of pancreatic cancer. During this time we read casually, promiscuously, and whimsically, allowing one book to lead us to the next. We read books we were given and books that had sat on our shelves for decades, waiting to be noticed; books we had stumbled across, and books we had chosen to reread simply because we felt like it. Were we looking for anything in particular? Usually not. At times, the books gave us something to talk about when we wanted to talk about anything rather than her illness. But they also gave us a way to talk about subjects that were too painful to address directly. They helped guide and prompt our conversations, so that I could learn as much as I could from my mother while she was still here to teach me.&nbsp;<br><br> At other times throughout my life, though, I&#x2019;ve felt a very specific need and have searched for a book to answer it. It hasn&#x2019;t always been easy to find the right book. Sure, when that burning need was to learn how to make a pineapple upside-down cake, I turned to <i>The Cake Bible. </i>Or when it was a need to find a place to eat in Chicago, the <i>Zagat </i>guide. Or when I wanted to self-diagnose that angry rash, to the <i>Mayo Clinic Family Health Book. </i>More and more, when I need this kind of information, my first line of attack isn&#x2019;t a book at all&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the Internet, or social media, where I quiz the ubiquitous &#x201c;hive mind&#x201d; to find, say, good Malaysian food near Union Square.&nbsp;<br><br> There are, however, questions that the Internet and the hive mind are spectacularly unable to answer to my satisfaction. These are the big ones, the ones that writers have been tackling for thousands of years: the problem of pain, meaning, purpose, happiness. Questions about how to live your life. Yes, the Internet tries to help&#x2014;inasmuch as any inanimate thing can be said to try to do anything. There are digital video channels devoted to streaming inspirational speeches from conferences in which people package insight into brief uplifting lectures&#x2014;many with a compelling hook and some memorable stories. But the best of these are often simply digests of&#x2014; or advertisements for&#x2014;a book that the presenter has written or is currently working on. Authors have always given lectures: there&#x2019;s nothing new in that. And readers, after hearing such speeches, have craved the books that go with them, so that they could explore the topics in greater depth and engage with them more fully&#x2014;working through the arguments at their own pace, skipping, savoring, and pondering.&nbsp;<br><br> Unlike most of these inspirational speeches, even the best of which tend to be largely self-referential, most good books are not tackling big questions in isolation. Great authors have been engaged in a dialogue with one another that stretches back for millennia. People who write books generally read books, and most books carry with them traces of some of the hundreds or thousands of books the writer read before attempting the one at hand.&nbsp;<br><br> And that&#x2019;s also why books can echo for centuries into the future. Even a book read by only a dozen people can have a massive effect if one of those readers goes on to write a book read by millions. British writer Henry Green (real name: Henry Vincent Yorke) never sold more than a few thousand copies of any of his novels, and most of his books sold far fewer than that. But the writers influenced by Green include Sebastian Faulks (whose <i>Birdsong </i>is one of the bestselling and most beloved British novels of all time), Eudora Welty, and Anthony Burgess (best known for <i>A Clockwork Orange, </i>which remains as shocking today as it was in 1962, when it was first published). John Updike wrote that Green&#x2019;s novels made &#x201c;more of a stylistic impact on me than those of any writer living or dead.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Henry Green died at age sixty-eight in 1973 and is largely forgotten. The books he influenced continue to be read and themselves inspire new works.&nbsp;<br> Sometimes books wear their influences loudly, mention- ing other books by name, like <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. </i>Sometimes the lineage is subtler, and the careful reader must tease out or guess at the influences. (How much of J. K. Row- ling&#x2019;s Harry Potter series was inspired by the classic 1857 boarding-school novel <i>Tom Brown&#x2019;s School Days, </i>by Thomas Hughes?) And sometimes authors hint at influences that aren&#x2019;t really influences at all but instead speak to the kind of book the author would have <i>liked </i>to have written.&nbsp;<br><br> Whenever I read, I try to be aware of these echoes and associations and aspirations. How did this book come to be? What books does this book resemble, and what books does it bring to mind?&nbsp;<br> Then, as the reader, I become influenced while I&#x2019;m read- ing. I&#x2019;m not the same reader when I finish a book as I was when I started. Brains are tangles of pathways, and reading creates new ones. Every book changes your life. So I like to ask: How is this book changing mine?&nbsp;<br> At the trial in which he would be sentenced to death, Socrates (as quoted by Plato) said that the unexamined life isn&#x2019;t worth living. Reading is the best way I know to learn how to examine your life. By comparing what you&#x2019;ve done to what others have done, and your thoughts and theories and feelings to those of others, you learn about yourself and the world around you. Perhaps that is why reading is one of the few things you do alone that can make you feel less alone; it&#x2019;s a solitary activity that connects you to others.&nbsp;<br><br> At fifty-four, I&#x2019;m now roughly the same age Dante was when he was putting the finishing touches on <i>The Divine Comedy. </i>I&#x2019;m the same age as von Aschenbach in Thomas Mann&#x2019;s <i>Death in Venice. </i>(I realized only recently that the character in this novella who was pining for a youth and his own lost youth was squarely in middle age; not having read the open- ing very carefully, I had always assumed that the &#x201c;old&#x201d; man who allowed the hotel barber to dye his hair jet black and garishly paint his face was in his seventies at the very least.) Fifty-plus is a good age for big questions. Unless I&#x2019;m that rare soul who makes it past one hundred, I probably have less time ahead of me than I&#x2019;ve already lived. Now that my brother, sister, and I are all over fifty, my brother, using a golf analogy, refers to our lives as being played on the back nine&#x2014;the first nine holes are behind us. Whatever score we&#x2019;ve accumulated, we carry with us. Suddenly, finishing honorably and staying out of the sand traps and water hazards matters more than seeing our names on the leaderboard.&nbsp;<br><br> On the other hand, I think any age is a good age for big questions. I asked some of my biggest and best when I was in high school and college&#x2014;fittingly, as that&#x2019;s what school is for. I asked other big questions at painful times in my life&#x2014; no age is immune from misfortune or feels it less keenly. And I hope and expect to be asking big questions right up to the end.&nbsp;<br> I know I&#x2019;m not alone in my hunger for books to help me find the right questions to ask, and find answers to the ones that I have. Because I work in publishing and wrote a book about reading, I meet a lot of readers. Readers of all ages have shared with me their desire for a list of books to help guide them. I&#x2019;ve heard from people who want classic novels to read; others just how-to books; others a list of titles from around the world. But most don&#x2019;t care what type of book or when it was written or by whom&#x2014;they just want books that will help them find their way in the world and give them pleasure while they are at it.&nbsp;<br><br> On an endless and turbulent plane ride from New York to Las Vegas, I sat next to a nineteen-year-old West Point plebe. We started chatting, and he soon was telling me about some of his favorite books; <i>The Alchemist </i>by Paulo Coelho was one. I told him I also loved that fable of the shepherd who travels to Egypt in search of treasure. Our conversation quickly moved from pleasantries to the meaning of life. (Maybe <i>The Alchemist </i>prompted that; maybe it was because the turbulence was increasingly extreme.) As the plane bounced around the sky, I began to babble about other books that had inspired me. The cadet said he would trade me a genuine West Point baseball cap for a list of my favorite titles. I can&#x2019;t remember most of what I wrote down. I love the cap; I hope he liked the books.&nbsp;<br><br> And then there&#x2019;s my ninety-six-year-old friend Else, who is always ravenous for book recommendations. Recently, I told her about a book by Ruth Ozeki called <i>A Tale for the Time Being. </i>In this novel from 2013, a writer in the Pacific Northwest finds washed up on shore various items, including the diary of a sixteen-year-old girl in Tokyo who is being horribly bullied and is quite sure she doesn&#x2019;t want to go on living. The novel moves between the story of the writer, passages from the girl&#x2019;s diary, and a collection of letters that accompanied it. The most indelible character in the book is the girl&#x2019;s hundred-and-four-year-old grandmother, a quietly charismatic Zen Buddhist nun with a fascinating past, who provides physical and emotional sanctuary when life becomes too awful for the girl to bear alone.&nbsp;<br><br> Else also has enormous charisma, but of a more boisterous variety. (That is, she swears a lot.) And she too has lived a remarkable life: a teenage refugee from Nazi Germany, she became a music editor for film. Else read <i>A Tale for the Time Being </i>with delight and had much to say about it. But more than anything she wanted to discuss the hundred-and-four-year-old Buddhist nun. Else hung on to her every word, and declared her one of the most astonishing characters she had ever encountered in fiction or nonfiction&#x2014;or in real life, for that matter. &#x201c;Now I know who I want to be when I grow up,&#x201d; she announced to me gleefully, laughing and clapping her hands together.&nbsp;<br> As for me, I&#x2019;m on a search&#x2014;and have been, I now realize, all my life&#x2014;to find books to help me make sense of the world, to help me become a better person, to help me get my head around the big questions that I have and answer some of the small ones while I&#x2019;m at it.&nbsp;<br><br> I know that the West Point cadet, Else, and millions of others are on this search, too, a search that began long before I was born and that will continue long after I&#x2019;m gone.&nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m not a particularly disciplined or systematic seeker. I don&#x2019;t give a great deal of thought to the books I choose&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll read anything that catches my eye. Most of the time when I choose what I&#x2019;m going to read it has absolutely nothing to do with improving myself. Especially when I&#x2019;m at my happiest, I&#x2019;m unlikely to search for a book to make me happier. But it&#x2019;s often during these periods of nonseeking that I&#x2019;ve stumbled across a book that has changed my life.&nbsp;<br><br> I believe that everything you need to know you can find in a book. People have always received life-guiding wisdom from certain types of nonfiction, often from &#x201c;self-help&#x201d; books starting with the progenitor of the category, Samuel Smiles&#x2019;s 1859 bestseller <i>Self-Help </i>(<i>with illustrations of Character and Conduct</i>)<i>. </i>But I have found that all sorts of books can carry this kind of wisdom; a random sentence in a thriller will give me unexpected insight. (If I hadn&#x2019;t read <i>Killing Floor, </i>the masterful 1997 novel that introduced the world to Jack Reacher, a former military cop turned vagrant, I never would have learned this valuable piece of wisdom, which still guides me in work and life: &#x201c;Waiting is a skill like anything else.&#x201d;)&nbsp;<br><br> I also believe that there is no book so bad that you can&#x2019;t find anything in it of interest. That, actually, is a paraphrase from the Roman lawyer Pliny the Younger, a sentiment later adopted by Miguel de Cervantes in <i>Don Quixote. </i>Admittedly, neither Pliny nor Cervantes were subject to some of the weakest &#x201c;sex and shopping&#x201d; books from the 1980s, but I still think it mostly holds true. You can learn something from the very worst books&#x2014;even if it is just how crass and base, or boring and petty, or cruel and intolerant, the human race can be. Or even if it&#x2019;s just one gleaming insight in a muddy river of words.&nbsp;<br><br> There is a proud tradition of extracting lines from poetry and songs and using them in this way. And for centuries, people have kept &#x201c;commonplace books&#x201d;: journals filled with transcriptions of quotes and extracts. But not everyone is a fan of cherry-picking odd passages from random books and using them to direct your life. Some people argue that lines from novels and plays are dependent on the context that surrounds them&#x2014;that it&#x2019;s unseemly and self-serving to grab the odd line here and there, especially if it comes in the voice of a character and may not have anything to do with what the writer thinks. I don&#x2019;t buy this. It ignores the way that your brain collects, refracts, sorts, and combines information. Our search for meaning isn&#x2019;t limited to thoughts that were created to be meaningful and packaged in verse or easily extractable chunks. We can find meaning in everything&#x2014;and everything is fair game. Your brain is, in fact, the ultimate commonplace collection, and everything you&#x2019;ve ever read is in there somewhere, ready to come back into your consciousness when you want or need it.&amp;n...</p><h2>The Leadership Secrets of Billy Graham</h2><p>A behind-the-scenes analysis of 21 essential leadership principles from the life of Billy Graham Billy Graham looms large as one of the twentieth century&#39;s most influential and innovative leaders. Most people are unaware of his remarkable effectiveness as not only preacher and pastor, but as a CEO and a global leader as well. The Leadership Secrets of Billy Graham is full of transferable applications for leaders in the church, parachurch, academia, government, and business. Lively interviews with his closest associates illustrate 21 principles that have driven six decades of visionary impact. First-hand accounts reveal stories of courageous leadership and growth through painful lessons. Graham&#39;s relentless application of core beliefs and leadership principles have resulted in, among many honors, being listed in Gallup&#39;s ten &#39;most admired men&#39; thirty times, more than anyone else. Time magazine named him one of the top ten leaders of the twentieth century. This book asks: How did this happen? What are the essentials he embraced to achieve such extraordinary results? What can we learn from him and apply to our own leadership roles? This book is dedicated to those readers . Who sense the pressing need in today&#39;s world for inspired leadership . Who rise to leadership&#39;s high calling and are willing to carry its weight . Who are determined to deepen and expand their capacities and effectiveness</p><p>Harold Myra is president and CEO of Christianity Today International, has taught at Wheaton College Graduate School, and is the author of several books, including Leaders and Surprised by Children.

DCI/ 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1One Coming Alive The giants all had one thing in common: neither victory nor success, but passion. PHILIP YANCEY How is it that among millions of young men of no particular distinction, one ignites and becomes a driving force? How is it that---like a rocket on a launch pad with flame barely visible---one person is slightly lifted, then slowly gains momentum, thrusts upward, engines burning steadily with increasing velocity? The phenomenon of Billy Graham&#39;s humble beginnings and the ever-increasing velocity of his executive leadership intrigued us. What combination of genes, culture, experience, religion, and internal response created the alchemy? This first section consists of just one extended chapter exploring those questions. How did his extraordinary leadership get started? How did it continue in force throughout his life? Numerous scholars and commentators have ranked Billy with the &#39;greats.&#39; We were intrigued to find, in seeking to identify common principles, parallels with other great leaders like Teddy Roosevelt, who was &#39;ignited&#39; by similar forces. To put Billy in context, we include those experiences too, which may illumine some of what happens in these extraordinary lives. C H A P T E R 1 Igniting! Absolute identity with one&#39;s cause is the first and great condition of successful leadership. WOODROW WILSON Leadership is forged in the furnace. The gracious, positive spirit of a Billy Graham---or the broad smile of a Dwight Eisenhower or the exuberance of a Teddy Roosevelt--- does not reveal the complex, painful stories of how they rose to great challenges or sustained their intensity. Far from being a formula to learn, leadership is a set of life experiences melded by intense heat. The heat and struggle create often unexpected results. Jim Collins, as he researched corporate leadership for his book Good to Great, was caught off-guard by his team&#39;s research findings. &#39;The good-to-great leaders seem to have come from Mars,&#39; is how he described his reaction to what they discovered about the very best corporate leaders. &#39;We were surprised, shocked really, to discover the type of leadership required,&#39; Collins wrote. What his team found was a paradoxical blend of humility and &#39;ferocious resolve.&#39; Those two characteristics don&#39;t easily meld. Only the furnace can extrude such seemingly opposite characteristics. Billy Graham&#39;s lifetime of leadership has, indeed, been paradoxical in blending extraordinary humility with fierce intensity of purpose. He fits Collins&#39;s descriptions of highly effective leaders, for out of that burning, paradoxical blend have come remarkable results. It&#39;s not just his countless television and stadium appearances or his leading the nation in times of grief or new beginnings. It has been his leadership of his team and of other leaders and of a broad Christian movement that has continually built momentum and created such impact on nations, cultures, and on millions of individuals. All this from a skinny farm kid from Charlotte, North Carolina? What ignited all this? Who could have come anywhere close to predicting it? Not his grade school teachers! According to one, he would have to be taken outside in the hall before he would recite his lessons. &#39;In the classroom, in front of the other students, he would hardly open his mouth. He was terribly shy and timid.&#39; His fifth-grade teacher said, &#39;I just couldn&#39;t get him to say a word in class. I remember once, he just sat there looking at me after I asked him a question, and I finally burst out in exasperation, &#39;Billy Frank, don&#39;t just sit there---say something. Please, just say something.&#39; Not a sound. He just kept staring at me. And to tell you the truth, I just forgot about him after he passed on out of school. Then, I don&#39;t know how many years later, I saw him for the first time on one of his television crusades. I simply couldn&#39;t believe it. His whole personality was so completely changed. He had such certainty, and the way the words were just pouring out---I kept thinking, somebody&#39;s putting the words in his mouth, he&#39;s just pantomiming it out. I couldn&#39;t get over it. I kept thinking, Is that actually Billy Frank Graham? What in the world happened to him?&#39; As a teenager, Billy&#39;s work on his parents&#39; dairy farm took a far backseat to girls and baseball. His wavy blond hair, sharp blue eyes, and ever-present smile attracted the girls, and his charismatic personality opened lots of doors. But a college classmate remembered not only the &#39;magic and charm of his youthful nature&#39; but also his &#39;loose, careless way,&#39; and his very messy room. &#39;We would have been absolutely staggered back then,&#39; he recalled, &#39;that he&#39;d be able one day to run such a large and complex organization.&#39; What in the world did happen to Billy Frank Graham? Immersion in the furnace of leadership formation began with a painful experience with a beautiful young woman. Emily Cavanaugh was a dark-haired college classmate whom Billy had asked to marry him, even though they had known each other only one semester. Her reluctance to immediately answer worried Billy; yet after months of deliberation, Emily finally accepted his proposal. But one evening at a class party she sat with him on a swing and told him she had to give back his ring. &#39;I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re right for each other. I just don&#39;t see any real purpose in your life yet.&#39; She was interested in an older student, Charles Massey. She saw in him what she didn&#39;t see in Billy---goals, plans, responsibility. Billy was devastated. &#39;All the stars have fallen out of my sky,&#39; he wrote to a friend. For months afterward, through the spring and summer, Billy roamed the streets for hours at night, praying for direction. He felt &#39;a tremendous burden.&#39; He was not simply grieving a romantic breakup but confronting reality. In fact, many realities. He didn&#39;t, in fact, have a sense of purpose. He had a vague sense that God was calling him to preach, yet he had an equal sense that he, like Moses, was not eloquent enough for the task. Some see such realities and simply move on.</p><h2>Le Cordon Bleu at Home</h2><p><p>Here is the first English-language cookbook from the Parisian cooking school whose very name epitomizes excellence. <em>Le Cordon Bleu at Home</em> provides a solid understanding of the philosophy and skills taught for nearly a century in the school's nine-month "Classic Cycle" course. Moving through three stages, from basic to advanced techniques, this in-depth approach to classical French cuisine offers a series of easy-to-follow menus and recipes that correspond to classes at the school. Nearly three hundred beautiful color photographs depict finished dishes, serving ideas, and cooking techniques at each stage through completion.</p><p>Learning to cook means mastering the fundamentals. In "Part One: Getting Started," you'll learn how to roast, poach, fry, saute, braise, and stew. You'll learn which cuts of meat are most appropriate for a dish, which utensils to use and how to use them, and preliminary preparations that simplify tasks. The menus focus on basic dishes -- from roast chicken and lamb to pan-fried sole, apple fritters, and poached fruit.</p><p>"Part Two: Perfecting Skills" takes you through pastry-making and introduces such preparations as p�t�s, souffl�s, consomm�s, and more. This is where you'll find such glorious dishes as Daube d'Agneau Avignonnaise (braised lamb cooked as it is in Avignon), Tournedos Baltimore (tenderloin steaks with Chateaubriand sauce), and Pilaf de Volaille � la Turque (Turkish-style pilaf with zucchini and oranges), created by Henri-Paul Pellaprat, one of the school's most famous instructors.</p><p>Ultimately, no one truly "finishes" learning -- the best chefs endlessly hone their skills. For advanced cooks, "Part Three: Finishing Touches" emphasizes the creative aspect of cooking.</p><p><em>Le Cordon Bleu</em> is the cr�me de la cr�me of cooking schools, and this is an indispensable volume for everyone interested in learning about the ageless art of French cooking. Combining time-honored traditions with the latest, most sophisticated methods and a variety of recipes ranging from standard at-home fare to classic, regional, and modern dishes, this is the ultimate state-of-the-art book on French cuisine.</p></p><p>This ``course'' in French cooking from the well-known Paris cooking school sets out to teach standard cooking techniques, sauces and stocks, and pastry magic in a series of 90 three-course menus that are arranged in three sections: basic, intermediate, and professional. The first 11 lessons (or menus) include boxed comments (not really very detailed) on saut&#x201a;ing, roasting, mayonnaise, choux pastry, and other basics. ``Technique photo''- strips throughout demonstrate operations from making an omelet to boning a rabbit. By the end of the book, you're into lengthier preparations (the medallion of venison surrounded by tartlets of celeriac and chestnut pur&#x201a;e is a two-day operation), preparing several terrines in aspic (one seafood, one rabbit) as starters, and serving what seems throughout to be an excessive number of courses in choux pastry shells. (One of these, filled with salmon and asparagus, calls for a total of 36 tablespoons of butter in a recipe for six that's described as a ``light'' dish in the modern style.) The menu arrangement makes the book heavy on pastries and desserts, and there is much butter, eggs, and cream everywhere. The Cordon Bleu name will lend cachet, but this doesn't notably stand out from other major French cooking tomes available, some of them more patiently detailed. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Here is a mother lode of contemporary cooking: lessons from the famed French Cordon Bleu cooking school. Unlike other culinary academies, which train cooking professionals, Le Cordon Bleu strives to educate the home cook in time-honored techniques invented and perfected by the French. And those who master the strategies of roasting, poaching and so on in the book's first section, "Getting Started," will "become familiar with a rich and varied repertoire of dishes that will do them honor and rival the best home cooking in France." Accordingly, the volume is organized by skill level with lessons ranging from French country fare like mussels with wine and cream sauce to more sophisticated creations--scampi bisque and orange mousse--to recipes representing the best (and most contemporary) of French cuisine, e.g., salmon rillettes with buckwheat blini and rum savarin with kiwis and strawberries. While illustrated with four-color photographs of foods and tough-to-master techniques, this is no coffee-table effort. It will be highly useful to serious cooks and novices.

What a difference a new format makes! This "re-imagined" edition of the classic story, originally published as <i>The Mystery of the Missing Red Mitten</i> in 1974, is now in an oversize format with color illustrations, and it seems like a delightful new offering. Annie has lost five mittens this winter, and she's in trouble. She and her dog, Oscar, set out to retrace her steps, through the deep, deep snow. As Annie and Oscar return to where they went sledding and built snow castles, the day's high jinks appear inset in boxes. They follow a bird, and the boxed action becomes Annie's imaginings: the bird has used her mitten for its nest; a mouse is using it for a sleeping bag. Annie wonders if it might be easier to grow new mittens; she thinks about planting her remaining mitten so she'll have a mitten tree next summer with enough mittens to give away on holidays. But when the sun comes out, and the snowman she has made begins melting, the mitten makes its appearance as a snowman's heart. Kellogg really outdoes himself with pictures that are filled with good cheer, warm spirits, and happy daydreams. He captures the way the light looks on a winter's day, and he also shows the way a room glows at Christmas when it's lit by candlelight. A book that's upbeat and touching by turns. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i></p><h2>Dinosaur Roar!

But I can't do that because it wouldn't be true. The truth is--I have told lies. I told lies when I was a child. And I have told lies as an adult. I was glad when people believed my lies, but I was never proud that I had lied to them. When people discovered I had lied about something, I always felt embarrassed and ashamed of myself. When I finally realized that telling the truth was important, I decided to be a more truthful person.

Beacuse I believe that telling the truth is so important, I wrote this book just for you. I hope you enjoy it. and I hope the book will help you to become a more truthful person. <p>Your Friend Adolph Moser</p></p><h2>Swimming in the Sink: An Episode of the Heart</h2><p>From inspired and inspiring open-water swimmer and supreme athlete, able to endure cold water temperatures that would kill others, author of <i>Swimming to Antarctica </i>(&#x201c;Riveting&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Sports Illustrated</i>) and <i>Grayson </i>(&#x201c;Moving, mystical&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>People)</i>&#x2014;a powerful book about super athleticism and human frailty, about invincibility and the sudden (mind-altering) repercussions of illness, and about the triumph of spirit, surrender, and love.<br><br>Lynne Cox is an elite athlete who broke many world records, among them swimming the English Channel at fifteen, being the first woman to swim across Cook Strait (eighteen miles), and being the first to swim off Antarctica in 32-degree water&#x2014;for twenty-five minutes!&#x2014;all without a wetsuit. <br><br>And that&#x2019;s where <i>Swimming in the Sink </i>begins&#x2014;at a laboratory at the University of London, with Cox&#x2019;s hand in ice-cold water, hooked up to thermocouples and probes, with three scientists trying to make sense of her extraordinary human capabilities. The test results paved the way for new medical and life-saving practices. <br><br>As an athlete, Cox had put her heart into everything she&#x2019;d ever accomplished. In turn her heart gave her great physical strength and endurance.<br><br>In the midst of becoming the embodiment of a supreme endurance athlete, Cox took care of her elderly parents, both of whom passed away in quick succession, followed by the death of her beloved Labrador retriever, leaving Lynne in shock from loss and loneliness and soon literally suffering from the debilitating effects of a broken heart.<br><br>On the edge of a precipice, Cox was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFib). As the prognosis went from bad to worse, Cox was in fear of living out a lesser life as an invalid with a pacemaker and a defibrillator and the real possibility of her own death was before her. Cox writes of her full surrender to her increasing physical frailty, to her illness, her treatment, her slow pull toward recovery. <br><br>In <i>Swimming in the Sink </i>we see Cox finding her way, writing about her transformative journey back toward health, and slowly moving toward the one aspect of her life that meant everything to her&#x2014;freedom; mastery; transcendence&#x2014;back to open waters, and the surprise that she never saw coming: falling in love.</p><p><b>LYNNE COX</b>&nbsp;was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and grew up in Los Alamitos, California. She has held open-water swimming records all over the world, swimming without a wetsuit. Cox has been inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. Her articles have appeared in many publications, among them <i>The New Yorker, The New York Times, </i>and the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine</i>. Cox lives in Long Beach, California.<br> &nbsp;<br>www.lynnecox.org1<br><br>The Bucket<br><br>I thought it would be easy to immerse my hand in a bucket of thirty-�two-�degree Fahrenheit water (zero degrees centigrade). I swam across the Bering Strait wearing a swimsuit in thirty-�eight-�degree Fahrenheit water (three degrees centigrade). I swam for two hours and six minutes and reached Russian shores. The water temperature in the bucket was only six degrees colder than the Bering Strait, but my hand ached. It was shouting at me to lift it out.<br><br>I was jet-�lagged and sitting wearing a swimsuit in a laboratory at the University of London. Dr. William Keatinge, one of the world&#x2019;s experts on the effects of cold on the human body, had asked me to participate in the study. He was measuring blood flow into and out of my hand in the cold. The goals of his studies were to contribute to medical research and learn more about how people survive in cold water.<br><br>There were monitoring devices attached to me: thermocouples on the fingers of my left hand, forehead, and right toe measuring my skin temperature. I had a rectal probe&#x2014;�a thin wire inserted in my body&#x2014;�measuring my core temperature.<br><br>Dr. Keatinge was standing near the monitoring devices with two researchers. They were watching the screens, and Dr. Mattie Scarborough, an internist, was sitting beside me to make sure I was okay.<br><br>I focused on the pace clock in front of me. The clock had two hands. The red hand was the second hand and the black hand was the minute hand. The red hand seemed to be moving slowly. It seemed like the seconds were minutes. I didn&#x2019;t think I would be so uncomfortable. I tried to focus on my breathing. My breathing was fast. I was anxious. I never knew what to expect when I was asked to participate in research tests. I should have known it would be challenging. These tests always were. I knew how to train for channel swims and I knew how to adapt to unexpected situations, but these tests were different. I had to push myself mentally and physically in ways I had never done. I never knew what would happen or what the outcome would be. It was exciting to explore with the researchers, and learn things we didn&#x2019;t know, but it was also challenging, and sometimes frightening.<br><br>How could six degrees Fahrenheit make that much difference? I thought my hand would adjust to the cold and it would relax; that&#x2019;s what happened when I swam in cold water. But my hand felt different in the bucket. It felt as if it were freezing to an ice tray. The pain made me queasy.<br><br>Dr. Keatinge warned me that the test could be difficult. He had run other tests on me, and he had accompanied me on my Bering Strait and Beagle Channel swims. These were swims that hadn&#x2019;t been done before. He was on the support boat to observe me and make sure I didn&#x2019;t go into hypothermia and die. Dr. Keatinge thought that I was very different from other people he studied. He was right.<br><br>From the moment I was born, my parents knew I was different. I was born almost a month early. My parents were worried. They weren&#x2019;t sure I would survive. My body was covered with fine, soft, wooly hair. My mom said that I looked like a little seal. They had never seen a baby covered with downy hair. It was a sign for them that I was going to be different. They worried when I was born because I weighed only five pounds. But I quickly put on weight, and I grew larger and much stronger than other children my age. I think it was a survival mechanism that kicked in.<br><br>My parents now worried that I was larger than other children, and my dad, who was a radiologist, had me tested. The pediatrician discovered that I have an efficient metabolism, which helped me thrive and become an endurance athlete. My parents encouraged me to swim, and I discovered that I loved being in the water more than on land.<br><br>I was lucky; at an early age I discovered something I would always love. I was lucky, too, because my parents always supported me and gave me a lot of freedom.<br><br>When I was only six years old, they let me visit the neighbors on my own. The neighbors were from all over the globe. I was intrigued by their differences, because I was different too. They told me stories about their childhoods and why they decided to come to America. They told me America was a special place where they could live their dreams while continuing to celebrate their cultures. They brought the art, food, and music from their homelands. Knowing them enriched my world and made me realize that being different was good.<br><br>My dad, a physician, said that the color of one&#x2019;s skin is only a wrapping. It doesn&#x2019;t matter. Everyone is human. Everyone needs to be cared for. My mom was an artist. She loved to paint pictures of people with different skin colors and physical characteristics. She said their differences made them beautiful. I realized that it was the differences among us that made life fascinating.<br><br>My neighbors liked me because I was different. Mrs. Smith said I was patient and determined. She liked me to visit her, and we had tea and cookies with her three orange cats and Heidi, her huge German shepherd with large white fangs.<br><br>Heidi had long shiny brown and tan fur and large brown eyes. She looked so soft and beautiful and I wanted to pet her, but Mrs. Smith said she would bite people who were not members of the family. My friends were afraid of Heidi and would never have petted her, but I thought I could find a way for her to like me. I took this on as a challenge.<br><br>One day when Beth, my Dalmatian, and I were walking past Mrs. Smith&#x2019;s home. Heidi ripped through the front screen door and attacked Beth, putting five large bloody punctures in her back. Beth was howling in pain as she ran home.<br><br>Heidi frightened me, but she was gentle with Mrs. Smith. She would put her head in Mrs. Smith&#x2019;s lap and nudge her arm with her wet black nose so Mrs. Smith would pet her.<br><br>I thought that if I was patient, Heidi would give me a chance. I visited Mrs. Smith every day, sat on her couch, and began by sticking out my index finger when Heidi walked past, so she would feel my touch. The first time I did it, she turned and glared at me. I thought she was going to bite me. But she just walked away. I was scared, but I did it again the next day, and the day after that.<br><br>I was patient. After a month I touched her with four fingers, and then one day she walked over to me and put her large head in my lap. I could feel the heat from her head, and I could feel her heart beating. Mrs. Smith said I could pet her.<br><br>Heidi had brown fur on her ears and muzzle that was so soft, and she closed her eyes when I scratched behind her ears. She was in bliss. I visited her every day after that. She walked beside me around the house, and she sometimes grabbed my hand in her mouth and asked me to pet her. But I always waited until I was sitting down and she put her head in my lap. She looked at me like she loved me. Her eyes were soft, and her mouth opened into a smile. We became friends. I learned that by being patient and persistent I could do what I wanted to do.<br><br>Sometimes Dr. Smith would come home when I was visiting his family. Dr. Smith, the oldest doctor in the neighborhood, had thin white hair and thick glasses, and he was always serious. I was a little afraid of him, but one day, I asked him if he liked cutting people open.<br><br>He seemed surprised and said he had never been asked that question. He said he didn&#x2019;t enjoy it, but it was what he needed to do to help people. He removed organs that were diseased or defective and repaired organs that were affected by an injury. I was fascinated by his abilities. He knew so much about life and the way the body functioned. My friends weren&#x2019;t interested in medicine, or in spending time talking with adults, but I was thrilled to hear his stories. I sought out the other doctors in the neighborhood to learn from them as well.<br><br>Dr. Duffy lived around the corner. He was an anesthesiologist and his daughter was my best friend. I would play with my friend and wait for him to come home after work. Dr. Duffy spoke with a slight Irish accent. He was short, bald, had bright blue eyes, and loved explaining how he put patients into a state of suspended animation so they wouldn&#x2019;t feel pain during surgery. I thought it was magic that he could put them to sleep so they didn&#x2019;t feel a thing.<br><br>Our other neighbor, Dr. Tung, was an anesthesiologist too. He studied anesthesiology in China and also did acupuncture. He explained how he inserted needles into different parts of the body to open passageways and reduce pain. It was difficult for me to imagine that sticking needles into someone&#x2019;s body could help relieve pain, but I believed him.<br><br>And I visited Dr. Nenopoulos. His daughter was my friend. He was an ob-�gyn and he knew I was a swimmer. He told me intriguing things about life. He said that babies swam around in their mothers&#x2019; stomachs in salt water for nine months. When they were born, he caught them, and then they took their first breath. He said that moment always seemed like a miracle to him, and it did to me too.<br><br>I loved learning about life and being with Arthur Daviau, my grandfather. He was a doctor and a long-�distance swimmer who swam across cold-�water lakes in Maine. He believed that genes had a great bearing on people&#x2019;s health and development. I thought I inherited my love for and acclimatization to cold-�water swimming from him. He thought so too.<br><br>My grandfather was a public health doctor and he knew that there were illnesses that were genetically carried in families. His cousin, Victor McKusick, was a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University, and he agreed. My grandfather knew that people could inherit good genes too. I thought I inherited his good genes and that predisposed me to becoming a long-�distance swimmer. I trained for years in cold water and I thought I was acclimated to the cold and that the cold-water immersion would be easy. But this test was the most difficult and excruciating I had ever endured.<br><br>I glanced at my hand in the bucket. It looked strange with the thermocouples attached to my fingers. My hand was ghostly white and shaped like a claw. When I swam across the Bering Strait my hands turned gray, but they never turned white.<br><br>The frigid water was shutting off blood flow to my hand. It wasn&#x2019;t receiving oxygen or warmth. I think the tissues were suffocating and starting to freeze. I wanted to open and close my hand to pump blood, warmth, and oxygen into it, but I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to move. That would interfere with the test.<br><br>Dr. Keatinge was standing near the entrance of the lab with two researchers. They were checking the monitors.<br><br>&#x201c;Lynne, are you okay?&#x201d; Dr. Keatinge asked. His blue eyes focused on me and his face was full of concern.<br><br>I nodded. I wasn&#x2019;t, but thought I would be.<br><br>He encouraged me. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re getting good readings. They will be helpful.&#x201d;<br><br>I reminded myself that I was doing this for a higher purpose, to further medical research. My dad had encouraged me to participate in cold studies. He said that in the future doctors would cool patients before heart surgeries to slow body functions and after heart attacks to reduce damage to the heart and give it time to recover. Doctors would cool patients after spinal and brain injuries to reduce swelling and trauma. The tests could also help researchers figure out how to rewarm people after life-�threatening cold exposure and increase their chances of survival.<br><br>The tests that were being conducted on me were already helping people. Dr. Richard Edlich, an emergency room doctor at the University of Virginia, had read Dr. Keatinge&#x2019;s studies and contacted me about the cold studies I was participating in at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of London. Dr. Edlich had multiple sclerosis and was trying to figure out how to improve treatment for the illness. He explained that people who have multiple sclerosis often have problems with balance, maintaining muscle strength, and spasticity. Heat and cold water could exacerbate spasticity. He experienced these symptoms, but he started swimming in cold water, and that helped him regain his muscle strength and balance, and reduced his spastic episodes. He discovered that if he swam in cool water for thirty minutes or more he experienced what he called a &#x201c;halo effect.&#x201d; After he climbed out of the swimming pool he was able to walk normally for two to three hours. He wondered if he could prolong this effect if he acclimated to lower water temperatures. But he had to make sure his core temperature didn&#x2019;t drop or he would shiver, his movements would become spastic, and he would have difficulty swimming and walking.<br><br>We discussed my training methods for acclimating to cold water and he adapted my process to his workouts. After a few months, he was able to swim in cooler water, for longer periods of time, and prolong the halo effect. He shared what he learned with other researchers. It helped me to remember him while I had my hand in the bucket of ice water. I hoped Dr. Keatinge&#x2019;s research would provide more answers to medical questions. But it was extremely difficult to stay focused on positive thoughts.<br><br>The pain was beyond anything I had ever experienced. I told myself that if I quit, the money, time, and effort everyone had invested in the tests would be wasted. It would be embarrassing. I had to endure. I wondered how I could interrupt the pain signals to my brain and break the pain cycle.<br><br>Out of the corner of my eye, I watched Dr. Scarborough. He was leaning forward in his chair. His large brown eyes were focused on me. His brow was deeply furrowed and his lips were pursed together.<br><br>I stared at the pace clock. I couldn&#x2019;t believe how long it took for one second to pass. It was strange how pain changed one&#x2019;s perception of time. When I trained in a swimming pool and used a pace clock the seconds flew by.<br><br>I dug my nails into my right hand and hoped I could&nbsp;trick my brain. If my right hand hurt some, I thought it<br> would diminish the pain in my left hand, but it didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;help.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dr. Scarborough had asked me to call him Mattie. He&nbsp;had not participated in this cold-water test, but the two researchers conducting the test had. Mattie monitored&nbsp;the research subjects to make sure they were medically<br> safe and consulted with the researchers. He explained&nbsp;that part of the protocol for conducting research on<br> human subjects was dictated by the Nuremberg Code,&nbsp;a set of research ethics for human experimentation that<br> was established as a result of the Nuremberg Trials after&nbsp;World War II. The code called for researchers to experience a study themselves before they tested other human subjects&#x2014;and most did so. They believed it gave them a greater understanding of what the subjects were experiencing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dr. Keatinge couldn&#x2019;t participate in the cold-water&nbsp;study because he had Raynaud&#x2019;s disease, which caused<br> blood vessels in his hands to overreact painfully to&nbsp;the cold. The arteries in his fingers went into vasospasm,<br> a sudden restriction of vessels that dramatically limits&nbsp;blood flow. The condition was extremely painful. He said<br> he was lucky he had a mild case. Some people lost their&nbsp;fingers ...</p><h2>Career Day</h2><p><p>Michiko's mother writes books. Jessica's mother is a veterinarian.

It is interrupted by Arendt's emigration and Jaspers's "inner emigration, " and it is resumed immediately after World War II. The initial teacher-student relationship develops into a close friendship, in which Jasper's wife, Gertrud, is soon included and then Arendt's husband, Heinrich Blucher. These letters show not only the way both philosophers lived, thought, and worked but also how they experienced the postwar years. Since neither ever dreamed that this correspondence would be published, and each had absolute trust in the other, they reveal themselves here - for the first time - in a personal and spontaneous way. Brilliant, vulnerable, forthright, Arendt speaks about America, her adopted country. About American universities, American politics from McCarthyism to Kennedy, American urban decay. She speaks about Germany, the country she left: its anti-Semitism, its guilt for the Holocaust, its politics. And about Israel, which she always supported as a Jew but also criticized, especially in her controversial book about the trial and execution of Adolf Eichmann in 1961. In his dialogue with Arendt, the thoughtful, generous, concerned Jaspers considers the question of the German essence, and of the Jewish character. He speaks about philosophers past and present - Spinoza, Heidegger. About old age and retirement. Corrupt journalism. Suicide. Man's future on this planet. Here is a fascinating dialogue between a woman and a man, a Jew and a German, a questioner and a visionary, both uncompromising in their examination of our troubledcentury. <br></p><p><p>Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) taught political science and philosophy at The New School for Social Research in New York and the University of Chicago. Widely acclaimed as a brilliant and original thinker, her works include Eichmann in Jerusalem and The Human Condition.</p>Text: English<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Book of Crafts, Kindergarten</h2><p>The creative arts are an essential part of the primary school education.

Based on extensive research amongst migrants who sell sex and social helpers, Sex at the Margins provides a radically different analysis. Frequently, says Agust�n, migrants make rational choices to travel and work in the sex industry. Although they are treated like a marginalised group they form part of the dynamic global economy.<br><br> Both powerful and controversial, this book is essential reading for all those who want to understand the increasingly important relationship between sex markets, migration and the desire for social justice.</p><p>Laura Mar�a Agust�n studies cultural and postcolonial issues linking commercial sex, migration, informal economies and feminist theory. She currently lives in London, researching the situation of migrant workers in the city&#39;s sex industry.""Sex at the Margins" rips apart distinctions between migrants, service work and sexual labour and reveals the utter complexity of the contemporary sex industry. This book is set to be a trailblazer in the study of sexuality." -- Lisa Adkins, Goldsmiths, University of London <br>"In restoring those living on the fringes of western societies to their full humanity, this invigorating book undermines our stereotypes and provides a challenging but unforgettable picture." -- Jeffrey Weeks, London South Bank University <br>""Sex at the Margins" elegantly demonstrates that what happens to poor immigrant working women from the Global South when they 'leave home for sex' is neither a tragedy nor the panacea of finding the promised land. Above all, Agustin shows that the moralizing bent of most government and NGO programs have little to do with these women's experiences and wishes. This book questions some of our most cherished modern assumptions, and shows that a different ethics of concern is possible." -- Arturo Escobar, University of North Carolina</p><h2>Margaret (Sunfire)</h2><p>Margaret, a young teacher at a one-room schoolhouse in rural Nebraska, finds herself torn between Gerald, an easterner teaching in another town, and Robert, a brooding farmer&#39;s son, and her worst student</p><p></p><h2>Blue Talk and Love</h2><p>The award-wining collection Blue Talk and Love tells the stories of girls and women of color navigating the moods and mazes of urban daily life. Set in various enclaves of New York City &#x2014; including the middle-class Hamilton Heights section of Harlem, the black queer social world of the West Village, the Spanish-speaking borderland between Harlem and Washington Heights, and historic Tin Pan Alley &#x2014; the collection uses magic realism, historical fiction, satire and more to highlight young black women's inner lives.The storylines range widely: a big-bodied teenage girl from Harlem discovers her sexuality in the midst of racial tensions at her Upper East Side school; four young women from Newark, New Jersey, are charged with assaulting the man who threatens to rape them; a pair of conjoined black female twins born into slavery, make their fame as stage performers in the Big City. In each story, the characters push past what is expected of them, learning to celebrate their voices and their lives.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.In the twenty tales told in this book, Charles &amp; Mary Lamb succeeded in paraphrasing the language of truly adult literature in children's terms. Let us not underestimate young readers: they love a complex story with many and varied characters, twists of plot, and turns of fate as much as anyone &#x2014; but they draw the line at reading in unfamiliar language. The Lambs provide a real feast of plain fare, and flavor it with as many tasty tidbits of Shakespearean language as they felt the young reader could easily digest. This deluxe Children's Classic edition is produced with high-quality, leatherlike binding with gold stamping, full-color covers, colored endpapers with a book nameplate. Some of the other titles in this series include: Anne of Green Gables, Black Beauty, King Arthur and His Knights, Little Women, and Treasure Island.</p><h2>Paradox Bound: A Novel</h2><p>Nothing ever changes in Sanders.

The one who&#x2019;s roared into his life twice before, pausing just long enough to drop tantalizing clues before disappearing in a cloud of gunfire and a squeal of tires.

It was summer, and she didn&#x2019;t want him inside watching cartoons or reading comics. She insisted a young boy needed fresh air and exercise.</p><p>Eli insisted what he really needed was to know how Voltron was going to form and beat the Robeast when one of the five lion keys was missing, but he was told in no uncertain terms that he did not. He was upset in principle more than in fact. They didn&#x2019;t have cable, and there was only so much picture the television&#x2019;s rabbit ears could coax out of the air from the distant Boston stations.</p><p>The bag lunch was a dry granola bar, a peanut butter sandwich on wheat bread with the crusts still on it, a green apple, and a thermos filled with cold water. No jelly, because it had too much sugar. No Ho-Hos, because they were nothing but sugar. Not even a juice box. Eli&#x2019;s mom had been on a health kick for a few months now, and he&#x2019;d been forced to spend part of his hard-earned allowance on Pepsi and snack cakes down at Jackson&#x2019;s. It cut into his comic-book budget, but his mom hadn&#x2019;t left him with much choice.</p><p>He kicked around in the yard for a while, then rode his bike along the shoulder to Joshua&#x2019;s house to see if his best friend had any comics he hadn&#x2019;t read. Joshua had come down with a cold, though, and his mother wouldn&#x2019;t even let Eli come in. And Corey was still away at summer camp, so there wouldn&#x2019;t be any new comics at his house either.</p><p>Eli rode his bike out past the old baseball field. He threw a few rocks at the stone wall that separated the outfield from the patch of woods behind the Catholic church, and then hiked out to throw a few more at the old rusted car he and his friends had discovered wedged between some trees one day. He went down to Jackson&#x2019;s and worked his way through the three wire racks of comics, even though he knew there wouldn&#x2019;t be any new ones until Wednesday and the new issue of <i>Amazing Spider-Man </i>wasn&#x2019;t due for another two weeks anyway. Then old Mr. Jackson told him to buy something or get out, so Eli bought a Pepsi and a Chocodile and rode back to the baseball field to sit in the bleachers and eat his now slightly improved lunch.</p><p>He weighed his options while he ate. Closer to the coast there were tourist attractions like beaches and video-game arcades and movie theaters. One of the towns to the south had a statue of the wrong soldier they&#x2019;d gotten after the Civil War, while one to the north had a guardian scarecrow. Over in New Hampshire were all the malls with tons of stores and shops. None of these were close enough to reach with his bike.</p><p>Not for the first time, Eli came to the inescapable conclusion that Sanders had to be the most boring town in the state of Maine. Possibly the most boring town in New England. While he didn&#x2019;t have a lot of worldly experience and had traveled very little, if asked, he would be willing to bet a whole dollar Sanders was the most boring town in the entire United States of America.</p><p>Sanders didn&#x2019;t even have a library. Or a school. Eli was bussed across the town line when school was in session. The old Sanders high school was used as a police station now.</p><p>Sanders didn&#x2019;t have anything interesting.</p><p>Eli finished his Chocodile and hid the evidence in a rust-flaked trash can next to the bleachers. It had been almost three hours since his mom had tossed him out, according to his calculator-watch. He could probably sneak home and hide in his room until afternoon cartoons started. He took a big bite of apple, moved it around his mouth with his tongue to hide any scent of chocolate, then spit the mouthful of fruit into the can. The apple itself followed.</p><p>He shoved the empty paper bag and full thermos into his backpack, swung his leg over his bike, and headed for home.</p><p>A little ways away from his house, he saw the car on the side of the road. It was old and small, but still took up too much room on the shoulder for Eli to squeeze by on his bike. He was either going to have to come to a stop, drag his bike into the woods and around the car, or go into the street. Being in the street was forbidden, and he would never risk it this close to home where his mom might see.</p><p>Still, Eli toyed with the idea of taking his bike onto the gray pavement anyway. It would only take a moment. His mom said he was too young, but he knew he was more than old enough. Just last month, after his eighth birthday, he had to insist his grammy stop getting him Duplo bricks and only get regular LEGO from here on in.</p><p>The old car had spindly wheels like Eli&#x2019;s bicycle and a funny roof like an old wagon. The windows in the back were stretched-out ovals. The whole thing was new-jeans-dark blue.</p><p>A car like that didn&#x2019;t belong on the side of the road. It didn&#x2019;t belong on the road, period. Not in Sanders, for sure. Even for a town that still didn&#x2019;t have cable television, it was too old. Too old for anyone in town, even old Mr. Jackson, who was almost fifty.</p><p>And then, as he mashed his pedals backwards and the bike crunched to a stop in the sand and rocks, Eli saw the older boy, who he would soon learn was named Harry.</p><p>Harry stood next to the car&#x2014;up on the car, on little platforms that ran along the bottom&#x2014;and stretched out across the hood, yanking on some kind of lever. He wore one of the old-timey outfits (even older than the car) that people wore for Fourth of July parades down in the Yorks or sometimes in Portsmouth. A blue coat, not as dark as the car, covered his body and swung back and forth with every movement.</p><p>Eli stepped off his bike, dropped the kickstand, and took a few steps toward the old car. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Whatcha doin&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>Harry responded by tossing a big wrench over his shoulder. It clunked headfirst on the side of the road and tipped over into the gravel next to an old toolbox. Then the older boy hopped down, clutching something round and silver in his hand. A vest that matched the coat wrapped around the teen&#x2019;s torso, and his oversized, off-white shirt poofed out around the vest&#x2019;s edges. He had long hair like a girl, but it was done up in a wide ponytail, like old-timey hair in schoolbook pictures.</p><p>Eli found this outfit odd&#x2014;although still not as odd as the car&#x2014;because usually only adults wore the Fourth of July costumes, or very young children (even younger than Eli, who felt quite old nowadays). On a guess, Harry was closer to eighteen or nineteen. Tall and slim, but not quite old enough to get the pinprick whiskers of grown men. Smooth as a baby&#x2019;s bum, as Eli&#x2019;s mom liked to say.</p><p>&#x201c;Kind of busy here,&#x201d; Harry said. &#x201c;You should head on home.&#x201d;</p><p>Eli took another step forward. The car&#x2019;s front glass&#x2014;the windshield&#x2014;was all cracked and broken. &#x201c;Is something wrong with your car?&#x201d;</p><p>The teenage boy nodded. &#x201c;Just out of fuel,&#x201d; he said. He gave the car an awkward pat. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be on our way soon, hopefully.&#x201d;</p><p>Eli pointed back down the road behind him. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a gas station in town,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They can help.&#x201d;</p><p>Harry shook his head. &#x201c;No, thank you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve only got a few minutes to get back on the road.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I could go get some gas for you,&#x201d; said Eli. He waved his arm back at his bike, thrilled with the idea something even slightly interesting was happening right on his street. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really fast.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need gas,&#x201d; said the older boy. &#x201c;My partner&#x2019;s off taking care of things.&#x201d; He glanced over his shoulder, then past Eli and down the road. His face was slack, the look of someone waiting to get back a quiz they knew they didn&#x2019;t do well on. &#x201c;You should get out of here, child.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I live right over there,&#x201d; said Eli, pointing the other way. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t. You should head home. Bad things are coming.&#x201d;</p><p>Eli glanced over his shoulder, but the road was empty as far as he could see. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; he asked, desperate to stretch out the encounter.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Harry,&#x201d; said the teenager. &#x201c;Now, go home.&#x201d;</p><p>He said the name in his head three times to make sure it stuck. &#x201c;Hello, Harry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Eli.&#x201d;</p><p>The older boy nodded, his gaze still on the road. Then his eyes went wide and looked down at Eli. He squeaked out the name again, like a high-pitched echo.</p><p>Something about the look worried Eli. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said, cautiously confirming his name.</p><p>Harry dropped to his knees and grabbed Eli by the shoulders. As he did his coat flared out and Eli saw two leather gun holsters on his hips, like movie cowboys wore. &#x201c;Oh my God,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Look at you! You . . . you&#x2019;re so cute.&#x201d;</p><p>Eli knew he was not cute. He was, in fact, very mature and grown-up. He no longer read <i>Richie Rich </i>or <i>Hot Stuff</i>, and made sure to only select comics from either Marvel or DC.</p><p>Harry was still holding him by the shoulders and still talking&#x2014; babbling, really&#x2014;about complications and Eli not being there and more demands for him to go home. It didn&#x2019;t make a lot of sense. It felt like Harry was rushing through stuff, the way adults would give quick answers when they didn&#x2019;t really want to explain things.</p><p>One word stood out at the end of the older boy&#x2019;s speech, and Eli latched onto it. &#x201c;I have water,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Harry froze. His fingers tightened on Eli&#x2019;s shoulders. &#x201c;You what?&#x201d; &#x201c;Water,&#x201d; said Eli. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got some if you&#x2019;re thirsty.&#x201d; He wiggled his arms until Harry let go, and then the pack slid down his back. He swung it around, unzipped it, and pulled out the bright-red thermos. He&#x2019;d stopped carrying the plastic Transformers lunchbox last year, but his mom still made him use the thermos. The picture of Optimus</p><p>Prime was chipped and worn away by hundreds of washings.</p><p>Harry&#x2019;s eyes got even wider. He snatched the thermos out of Eli&#x2019;s hands, tossed the cup-lid aside, and unscrewed the top. He pushed his nose into it and sniffed hard. His bright-green eyes locked on Eli&#x2019;s as he hefted the thermos.</p><p>Then he leapt off the ground and raced to the front of the car. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s better than nothing,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Eli ran after him, clutching the backpack to his chest. &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d;</p><p>Harry stretched across the hood. Near the center of the windshield sat a small opening that reminded Eli of the top of a jar. Harry carefully emptied the thermos into the tank, shaking the last few drops in, then resealed the cap with a few quick twists of his wrist.</p><p>He tossed the thermos back to Eli and dashed around to the other side of the car. He reached in and flipped a few switches on the dash- board. There were a lot of switches, and some lights, and it all looked a bit more like a spaceship than a car.</p><p>The car puttered to life.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Eli cried out. &#x201c;You said you were out of gas.&#x201d; He gave Harry a well-practiced glare, the look of a child lied to by an older person.</p><p>&#x201c;I said I was out of fuel,&#x201d; the older boy said. &#x201c;And you gave me close to a pint.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just gave you water.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a lifesaver, if I haven&#x2019;t mentioned that yet.&#x201d; He slid into the driver&#x2019;s seat and settled behind the wheel.</p><p>Eli stared at the dashboard again. &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; someone yelled.</p><p>Eli looked up and saw a shaggy man jogging toward the car. He had a Bond-villain hat and wore a scratchy-plaid jacket over a pale- blue sweatshirt, even though it wasn&#x2019;t cold out. He had dark hair and a scraggly beard, like people on TV who got lazy and didn&#x2019;t take care of themselves for a couple of days. His mom said it was how homeless people looked. He held a red gas can in his arms, one of the plastic square ones like they sold down at the station.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d you get it running?&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>&#x201c;Quiet!&#x201d; yelled Harry. He ran back to meet the older man in front of the car.</p><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t get anything, the faucet was rusted solid,&#x201d; the man said. He looked at Eli.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Quiet,&#x201d; the older boy told him again. He knocked the gas can away from the homeless man and muttered some quiet words to him.</p><p>The man stared at Eli&#x2019;s bike, then at Eli. Eli stared back. He wondered if the homeless man was Harry&#x2019;s older brother. Or just some hitchhiker Harry was giving a ride to. Or if he was going to try to take Eli&#x2019;s bike.</p><p>Harry hit the man&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Now!&#x201d;</p><p>Harry slipped past Eli and jumped into the car. The homeless man held out an old-timey triangle hat, which Harry yanked onto his head. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; said the older boy. He snapped his fingers and pointed down at the pavement under Eli&#x2019;s shoes. The homeless man flinched. &#x201c;Your mother doesn&#x2019;t want you in the street, yes?&#x201d;</p><p>Eli glanced down. He&#x2019;d followed Harry around to the driver&#x2019;s side without thinking.</p><p>&#x201c;Get off the road and stay there,&#x201d; Harry told him. &#x201c;In fact, stay there for a few minutes after I go, just to be safe, okay?&#x201d; He pointed back to the sand-and-gravel shoulder where the bike stood.</p><p>Eli nodded and looked back at his bike. Something moved on the edge of his vision, down the road. There was another car coming. Coming fast. He could hear its engine.</p><p>Harry looked at the mirror mounted on the door. &#x201c;Time to go,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;See you in a couple of years, Eli.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>The old car lunged forward. Eli was showered in loose grit and dust as the wheels spun and hurled the vehicle up onto the road. The tires squealed and left thin black tracks against the gray pavement. He coughed twice and the older boy&#x2019;s car was already past Eli&#x2019;s driveway and zooming away.</p><p>He watched the car vanish down the road and around the far bend where it stopped being Mill Road and became Abbot Drive. The sound of its engine faded, but even as it did another sound grew. A growl like an angry dinosaur or a werewolf or something else that should only be on the Channel 56 <i>Creature Double Feature</i>. It was so loud it almost hurt.</p><p>Eli stepped off the road. His shoes crunched in the gravel and the last swirls of dust settled around them. He breathed out and took new air into his lungs.</p><p>The summer before, somewhat against his will, Eli had been enrolled in pee-wee baseball and somehow ended up playing third base. It had been almost fun until the day Zeke the Freak, an oversized kid with a jaw like an ape, had sent a line drive right at third. Eli had been looking at something else, heard the crack of the bat, and turned to see the base- ball hanging in the air a foot from his face. Each individual red stitch stuck in his memory, along with curly letters that spelled out WLINGS and a scuff of dirt that crossed one of the stitch lines. Then the ball had struck him in the cheek and knocked out his last three baby teeth. Blood had flowed and Eli had shrieked and Zeke had cackled and a year later he could still remember that moment of the ball hanging in the air.</p><p>Eli turned around on the side of the road, and time froze.</p><p>The black car was caught in mid-pounce, like it didn&#x2019;t drive so much as lunge forward along the strip of pavement. It seemed heavier in the front, and a thin line of silver ran along its side. The windows were short and rounded on the corners.</p><p>Across the width of the car, the driver stared at Eli. His face was shadowed by a black hat, but there was enough sunl...</p></p><h2>Dirr&#39;s Trees and Shrubs for Warm Climates: An Illustrated Encyclopedia</h2><p>Following the phenomenal success of Dirr&#39;s Hardy Trees and Shrubs, written for gardeners in the climates of USDA zones 3-6, this companion volume is a superlative photographic encyclopedia of trees, shrubs, and vines for &#34;warm temperate&#34; zones. In North America, these areas (zones 7-11) stretch from the Mid-Atlantic states to the South, include most of Texas and the Southwest, and encompass the entire West Coast, up to western Canada. Many parts of the British Isles, Australia, and New Zealand experience similar conditions. In a nutshell, any gardener who lives in an area where average winter temperatures do not fall below 0� Fahrenheit (-18� Celsius) will want this book, and curious gardeners in colder zones may well want to test these select plants in their local microclimates. This remarkable volume shows both the habit and details-flower, fruit, bark, fall color-of more than 400 species and describes hundreds more cultivars and varieties. Certain genera offer myriad hybrids and selections, and photographs of many of the best of these are included as well-nearly 40 named crapemyrtles, a dozen teaolives, and 11 loropetalums. In all, more than 1400 photographs join with the authoritative text to bring the plants to life. From Abelia to Ziziphus, gardeners will encounter many new and unfamiliar plants that thrive in warmer climates. Dirr gives special attention to hardy palms that can survive outside the subtropics. The book also reflects the author&#39;s inimitable personality, which holds nothing back when a plant deserves outright acclaim (&#34;If prescriptions could be written for perfect garden plants, this species would come close to filling the order&#34;), backhanded praise (&#34;Use for accent, for novelty, or to drive visitors loony&#34;), or frank condemnation (&#34;Splays to the point of no redemption with time&#34;). The book concludes with useful lists for selecting plants for a variety of conditions or for ornamental characteristics, such as flower color and fragrance, fruit, and fall color.</p><p>Following the phenomenal success of Dirr&#39;s Hardy Trees and Shrubs, written for gardeners in the climates of USDA zones 3 to 6, this companion volume is a superlative photographic encyclopedia of trees, shrubs, and vines for &#34;warm temperate&#34; zones.Michael A.

Gyatso taught at Amherst College before coming to Harvard as the Divinity School's first Hershey Professor of Buddhist Studies.Introduction (Janet Gyatso) <p>The Lives and Liberation of Princess Mandarava is an extraordinary story from the heart of Tibetan religious culture about the Buddhist liberation of a woman.1 Recounted from the magisterial perspective of a female buddha-Pandaravasini-and her emanations in the world, the story tells of life after life of compassionate manifestations in samsaric trouble spots, where the heroine uses her splendor, magical powers, and often her feminine charms to tame demons and teach the Buddhist messages of impermanence, compassion, and enlightened insight to all. This superwoman's story has a fairytale quality that is counterbalanced by the real-life problems of women in Indian and Tibetan society that the work repeatedly addresses: the assumption that all women must marry, their control by the men in their lives, and the lack of respect for them in society at large. In the final long episode of the heroine's life as the consort of Padmasambhava, these themes are writ large in her struggles with her parents and her censure by those around her on account of her controversial relationship with the tantric master. She is finally victorious in these struggles, but only after an arduous path of self-cultivation and self-expression. </p><p>The version of the story translated in this book dates from the turn of the twentieth century, but the figure of Mandarava has long occupied a chapter in the larger narrative of Buddhism's introduction of in Tibet, in which Padmasambhava plays such a leading role. But like its counterpart, the lifestory of the famous Tibetan female saint Yeshe Tsogyal (who also became a consort of Padmasambhava), the tale of Mandarava and her previous lives goes far beyond its significance for Tibetan national history and identity.2 It is replete with messages of encouragement for women of many Buddhist traditions. In order to appreciate the meaning that its exceptional, proto- femininist themes might have had for its traditional audience-that is, its readers, male and female alike, as well as the auditors of its oral renditions-some general background in the lifestory tradition in Tibet and in Buddhist literature might be helpful to convey a sense of the history and religious practices of the cultural milieu from which the work originates. </p><p>All lifestories in Buddhist literature model themselves on the lifestories of the Buddha, which began to be written by the first century B.C.E. Most importantly, the plot of Shakyamuni's lifestory, his steps to buddhahood and his enlightened activity thereafter, set the standard for all exemplary Buddhist lives. Mandarava's own story shares this basic orientation. The work translated here recounts how she first achieved enlightenment in the distant past as the buddha Pandaravasini (chapter 2). The process seems to be repeated in her last lifetime as Mandarava when she achieves the status of an immortal awareness holder (vidyadhara, rig 'dzin) after rigorous training at Maratika (chapter 30) and then wins the ultimate rainbow body at death (chapter 37). The explanation for the repetition may be that Mandarava's second enlightenment was meant as a display or model for others on the path. In any event, it is the lifestory of Mandarava that is recounted in most detail in this book and that serves most prominently as an exemplary life for the student. Many of its moments repeat similar moments in the lifestories of the Buddha: her deliberate choice of parents; the auspicious dreams of parents and other significant indications at her conception; her precocious words and signs of advanced realization at birth; the sights of old, sick, and dead people that disillusion her and inspire a renunciatory attitude; her escape from the palace and periods of ascetic practice; her later efforts to teach and train. The parallel of her story with that of the Buddha is especially obvious in the overview summary that the text itself provides at the close of chapter 1. When the reader recognizes these elements as typical themes in the lifestory of a Buddhist saint, it becomes an important sign that the life being told is going in the same direction and that the protagonist too is a Buddhist saint. Such conventions structure the large proportion of hagiographical and biographical literature in Tibet-a genre that, significantly, is labelled "full liberation [story]" (rnam thar). Hundreds of such works were produced in Buddhist Tibet; it is important, first of all, to place the work translated in this book within that tradition. </p><p>The impact that the story of liberation has on its readers and hearers has been given paramount importance since the inception of lifestory literature in Buddhism... </p><p>In Tibetan literature, the lifestory of an enlightened master is also said to have a positive impact by causing marvel and wonder in the reader. This is the expected response to narratives of fantastic powers, intergalactic travel, and scintillating meditative experience. Such features were well known in Indian story literature and became prominent in the Mahayana sutras and the Puranic renditions of the exploits of the Hindu deities and their avatars. Much of the cosmic, miraculous quality of Mandarava's story can be understood as influenced by this large and heterogenous tradition, as are many other Tibetan narrative cycles. Stories of the founders of lineages are particularly likely to contain such marvelous dimensions; they are certainly central to the cycle of stories surrounding Avalokiteshvara and his manifestations in Tibet, as well as to the lifestory tradition of Padmasambhava, with which the Mandarava story is directly connected.3 The idea is that the spectacular vision of a magnificent cosmic heritage will inspire faith in the religious practices the story represents....</p></p><h2>The Cove (FBI Thriller, No. 1)</h2><p>Follows the investigation of FBI special agent James Quinlan, who journeys undercover to the picturesque town of The Cove, where Sally St. John Brainerd is hiding from police who would question her about her possible involvement in her father&#39;s murder, a case that is complicated by two additional deaths and Sally&#39;s disappearance.

Children count from 1 to 10 with Nothando as she plants a pumpkin seed that grows to bear fruit for a delicious stew. "One child, one seed. Two hands to plant the seed. Three ways to help it grow," the text reads. But that is just the beginning in this gem of a book. In a harmonious partnership of narrative and crisp, beautifully composed photographs that show the individuality of each person, readers get a glimpse into the life of an extended family living in a rural South African community. Spreads consist of a left-hand counting page where the story of the seed is told through a minimal text and color photograph that clearly shows the objects to be counted. On the opposite page, the narrative continues with a line of large-print text, along with a small photo and additional text offering further details about the life of this community, including games, transportation, and the local store. The only quibble is that Nothando and her extended family are not shown enjoying the long-awaited feast. The recipe for isijingi, the pumpkin stew, is included as are some basic geographical facts and a simple map. The writing has good rhythm, and reads aloud well. All in all, this fine counting book is a welcome addition to any collection, and will enrich harvest units.<br><i>Sue Giffard, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York City</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Dead Season: A Raine Stockton Dog Mystery</h2><p><b>Praise for the Raine Stockton Dog Mystery Series</b> <p> "An exciting, original and suspense-laden whodunit...

His Romanian novels <i>Captured</i> and <i>Burial of the Vine</i> are classics of the resistance against totalitarian art. Moving to the United States, he wrote movies including <i>The Last Wave</i> and <i>Death of an Angel</i>, before returning full time to authoring books. <i>The Encounter: Amazon Beaming</i>, <i>Almost Adam</i>, <i>The Return</i>, and <i>The Oasis</i> made him known worldwide. In <i>The Encounter</i>, he renders the discoverer of the Amazon's source, Loren McIntyre, as an unforgettable protagonist for his unique experiences in the rain forest among indigenous people, and for his inward explorations, pursuing the potential to win one's spiritual freedom. Freedom is clearly Popescu's signature motif. He is married to screenplay writer Iris Friedman, and they live in Los Angeles.<br><br>Born in London in 1957, Simon McBurney is an actor, director and writer, as well as the founder and artistic director of the acclaimed UK theatre company Complicite, whose productions include <i>The Master and Margarita</i> and <i>A Disappearing Number</i>.The strange and wonderful tale of National Geographic photographer Loren McIntyre's mystical journal from the depths of the Amazon basin to the river's ultimate source in the Andes, solemnly related by Popescu (The Last Wave; In Hot Blood, 1988 paperback.) With 40 years of Amazon exploration under his belt, as well as subsidiary careers in the US Navy and as a documentary filmmaker, McIntyre jumped at the chance to experience and photograph a ``first contact'' with an elusive Mayoruna tribe rumored to exist on the shores of the Rio Javari, an Amazon tributary. Airdropped onto the river's shore, McIntyre easily joined up with the seminomadic ``cat people''--who tattooed their faces and stuck spines in their cheeks to resemble their claimed jaguar ancestors- -but soon became hopelessly lost following their flight from an unseen enemy. Worried that his hired pilot would never find him, unable to speak the Indians' language, and suffering severe culture shock from jungle life, McIntyre nevertheless became fascinated by the Mayoruna headman, who seemed to communicate with the American through what McIntyre called ``beaming''--or mental telepathy. McIntyre apparently received mental messages regarding the tribe's plan to escape modern encroachers by traveling ``back to the beginning''--fasting, dancing, and ingesting natural hallucinogens to return to the safety of the beginning of time. After witnessing this ceremony, McIntyre returned to civilization, but he would experience a psychic reunion with the tribe--and, perhaps, their ancient ancestors--two years later while combing the Andes for the true source of the Amazon. Three stories--McIntyre's contact with the Mayoruna, his discovery of the Amazon's source, and his own inner, spiritual exploration--make for an occasionally unwieldy bundle of a book, but Popescu's awe, combined with McIntyre's general stupefaction, makes for fascinating reading. A sort of Castaneda exercise in mystical and ecological inquiry, perfectly timed for the New Age. (Sixteen pages of color photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

What binds these aberrant types together in a compelling narrative is a remarkable gift for incisive language: Duffy's father, a World War II fighter pilot, "bit the big bagel"; "gold was good, a commodity that always gave the same answer"; and, "In the nation of the heart, there's war enough for everybody." That Duffy finds salvation is the most surprising twist of all. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Crews once wrote in Playboy about the joys of getting beaten up. Now comes Duffy Deeter, also of Gainesville, Florida, also husband and father, also believing "there was nothing so refreshing as getting your ass kicked." Deeter's athleticism would seem to offer little prospect of reconciling him with his distracted mother, his boy ("a huge, soft, white slug"), or his wife, who has become frigid (except with Deeter's law partner). Luckily, Deeter gets into a fight with black pro-footballer Tump Walker; they become fast friends and Walker is soon putting things to rights in the Deeter household. Crews and Deeter are to be congratulated for their suspicion that there might be a better way to live, but sincerity undermines satire and slapstick. The result is not likely to please Crews's old audience nor find him a new one. Hugh M.

Chill bumps rushed up her spine. She dipped under the rope.<br> <br>Crouching into a half squat, he tossed the sword to his other hand, formed a half circle with his arms, and darted his gaze between them.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Dr. Billy Jack Tate.&#x201d; Her voice carried in the sudden quiet, similar to the way it traveled across the frozen pond at her sister&#x2019;s place. She maintained a calm, reasonable tone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a surgeon and a speaker here at the Congress. We want no trouble.&#x201d; She turned her attention to the woman called Martha. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;d best do as he says. He&#x2019;s given a pledge to follow orders and the orders are no one goes inside. We are not a bunch of barbaric men, but women. Women much too sensible and creative to resort to brute force.&#x201d;<br> <br>A long, tense moment crackled between them. Finally, the woman jerked up her chin and spun about. Again, she straddled the rope rather than ducking underneath.<br> <br>The guard did not relax his posture, did not replace the sword in its scabbard, and did not remove the force of his gaze. &#x201c;Step down.&#x201d;<br> <br>Billy offered him a calm smile. &#x201c;I mean no threat. I really am a speaker and I really do need to slip inside. My address begins in&#x201d;&#x2014;she glanced at her watch pin&#x2014;&#x201c;thirty-eight minutes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re no more a doctor than I am a housewife. Now step down.&#x201d;<br> <br>She bristled. &#x201c;I most certainly am a doctor. I earned a medical degree from the University of Michigan, I&#x2019;ve practiced in hospitals all across this country for the past seven years, I&#x2019;m an expert on anatomy, and my speech is about being a woman in a man&#x2019;s profession. Now, you step down or I&#x2019;ll let the organizers of this Congress know just exactly who&#x2019;s responsible for keeping me from addressing the thousands who are waiting to hear from me.&#x201d;<br> <br>With each qualification, his expression became more and more amused until, with her final threat, he emitted a short huff. At least he&#x2019;d straightened and lowered his sword, though he hadn&#x2019;t put it away. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll hand it to you, miss. You&#x2019;re quick on your feet. But you&#x2019;re the one who said women were crafty, not me. Either way, I&#x2019;m not one to be taken in by a pretty face.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Creative. I said we were creative, not crafty.&#x201d;<br> <br>He tucked the sword away. &#x201c;Same thing. Now, go on. I&#x2019;m not letting you or anybody else inside.&#x201d;<br> <br>She glanced at the door. &#x201c;But I really am who I say I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>With a heavy sigh, he shooed her with his hands. &#x201c;I mean it. You can either get yourself back on the other side of that rope or I&#x2019;ll have Willie over there escort you to the patrol wagon. From there, you&#x2019;ll go straight to the city jail. And Chicago&#x2019;s is a particularly nasty one that doesn&#x2019;t do a good job of separating the woman prisoners from the male ones.&#x201d;<br> <br>With a touch of unease, she glanced to the area he indicated with his head. Amidst millinery of all sizes and shapes, a rather burly man stood only a few steps away. He tipped his hat.<br> <br>Lips tightening, she flounced back down the steps. She&#x2019;d have to try another entrance. But the building was huge. By the time she shoved through the crowds and appealed to each guard, the slot for her address would be over and gone.<br> <br>She should have allowed herself more time. But she hadn&#x2019;t expected so many women, and she certainly never considered a building such as this would fill to capacity.<br> <br>Before slipping underneath the rope, she looked back over her shoulder. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have your name&#x2014;so I can tell the officials who barred my way.&#x201d;<br> <br>He gave a bow. &#x201c;Peter Stracke. But everybody calls me Pete.&#x201d; He gave her a wink.<br> <br>She ducked under the rope. The women immediately forged a path for her. Mr. Stracke might not have believed her, but they did and they had the utmost respect for her.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d gone no more than ten yards when an old country woman grabbed her hand. &#x201c;Doc?&#x201d;<br> <br>Billy nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can get ya in.&#x201d; She looked both ways, then leaned closer. &#x201c;But it won&#x2019;t be through no doors.&#x201d;<br> <br>Billy wasn&#x2019;t sure which was more potent, the smell of the woman&#x2019;s breath or the smell of her unwashed body. It wasn&#x2019;t the woman&#x2019;s fault, though. The importance of good hygiene was something those in Billy&#x2019;s profession were in constant argument over. And though she felt she was in the right, she was very much in the minority.<br> <br>She looked at her watch. Twenty-four minutes left. &#x201c;Is it fast? Does it involve any guards?&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman smiled, more teeth missing than present. &#x201c;Jus&#x2019; follow me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Skirting around an enormous bronze lion flanking the entrance, the woman led her onto the grass and toward the north side of the building. The farther they walked, the less congested it was until finally they reached the fringes of the crowd.<br> <br>&#x201c;Quick, over here.&#x201d; Ducking beside a puny bush, the woman dropped to her knees and began to jiggle a cellar window.<br> <br>Billy glanced behind them. No guards within sight, but several women watched unabashedly. With a growing smile, one of them corralled those around her, then directed them to turn their backs and form a human wall around Billy and her cohort.<br> <br>The gesture warmed her heart. Women were a wonderful breed. Such a shame they didn&#x2019;t run the country.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a nail loose.&#x201d; The woman grunted, her entire body shaking as she continued to rattle the window.<br> <br>Dropping down beside her, Billy tried not to think about the moist dirt beneath her knees. Better to arrive with a soiled skirt than not at all. Lining up her fingers along the opposite side of the frame, she pressed as hard as she could.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s breath came in huffs. &#x201c;I clean this place at night. I been tellin&#x2019; the menfolk about this window for months now, but they can&#x2019;t be bothered with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Without warning, the frame swung inward, crashing against the wall. The momentum slammed Billy into the stone wall above the opening. The rim of her hat wrenched its pins to an awkward angle and ripped the hair entwined by them.<br> <br>Sucking in her breath, she pushed away. At least her hat had protected her face. If the brim hadn&#x2019;t stopped her, she&#x2019;d have likely broken her nose.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go on.&#x201d; The woman waved her arm toward the window.<br> <br>Ignoring the pain in her scalp, Billy considered her options. There was nothing for it but to lie full out on the ground and shimmy herself in. With a sigh, she flopped down and stretched her arms toward the opening. She was a quarter of the way through when she realized the window was level with the ceiling of the cellar.<br> <br>She returned her hands to the opening and pulled herself backward. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have to go feetfirst. It&#x2019;s a good eight-foot drop to the floor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Entering feetfirst wasn&#x2019;t nearly as easy as headfirst. The old woman grabbed Billy&#x2019;s ankles and guided her feet through.<br> <br>Raising up on her arms, Billy propelled herself as far toward the window as best she could, then collapsed to her tummy and lifted her hips. Like a worm she inched backward, her body making progress, her skirts and petticoats staying where they&#x2019;d started.<br> <br>Without too much effort, her pantalet-clad legs made it inside and dangled against the freezing-cold stone cellar wall. But her skirts were inside out, cocooning her upper body within their folds and inhibiting all progress.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m stuck,&#x201d; she called, sputtering against the fabric of her skirts.<br> <br>Within seconds, all hands were on deck and bodily lowering her the rest of the way in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; she squeaked. &#x201c;Slow down! My dress&#x2014;it&#x2019;s going to tear. And I&#x2019;m . . . I&#x2019;m going to fall!&#x201d;<br> <br>The women clutched her arms, their grips digging into tender flesh.<br> <br>Billy lifted her head, the brim of her hat hitting the edge of the window. &#x201c;Easy. Go as slow as you can.&#x201d;<br> <br>The rough wooden frame scraped against her midsection, tearing the delicate cotton of her corset cover. Her pantalets traveled up her legs, bunching at her thighs.<br> <br>In an effort to see how far she was from the floor, she wiggled her feet. Nothing but open air.<br> <br>They lowered her a bit more. Pain shot through her arms at the awkward angle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; she breathed. &#x201c;Let go of my right arm.&#x201d;<br> <br>They released it. The pain in her left arm increased tenfold.<br> <br>She pulled her free arm inside and steadied herself against the wall. &#x201c;When I count to three. Ready? One . . . two . . . three.&#x201d;<br> <br>They let go. She hit ground almost immediately, then her knees gave. Between her tangled skirts and the unforgiving floor, it took her a moment to orient herself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Doc?&#x201d; It was the old woman. &#x201c;You all right?&#x201d;<br> <br>She took a mental catalog of all extremities. Other than weak knees and throbbing arms, everything seemed to be in working order. &#x201c;Yes. Yes! I&#x2019;m good. Thank you so much.&#x201d;<br> <br>Instead of a chorus of encouragement, she heard nothing. Complete silence. Eerie silence.<br> <br>A drop of moisture from the ceiling plopped to the floor. Pushing the hair from her face, she straightened her hat and looked up at her comrades. Four faces peered through the window. All attention was focused on the opposite wall.<br> <br>The hairs on the back of her neck prickled. Please, don&#x2019;t let it be a rat. She hated rats.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; she hissed.<br> <br>They said nothing, their eyes wide.<br> <br>Careful not to make any sudden moves, she drew her legs beneath her and straightened, inch by inch by inch.<br> <br>Finally, she turned, then sucked in a breath.<br> <br>The silhouette of a man&#x2014;no, not a man, a guard.

News of the discovery of the Ice Man and his age, which was put at over five thousand years old, fascinated the world. But what made the story particularly extraordinary was that Professor Sykes was also able to track down a living generic relative of the Ice Man, a woman living in Britain today. How was he able to locate a living relative of a man who died thousands of years ago? In The Seven Daughters of Eve, Bryan Sykes gives us a first hand account of his research into a remarkable gene which passes undiluted from generation to generation through the maternal line and shows how it is being used to track our genetic ancestors through time and space. After plotting thousands of DNA sequences from all over the world he found that they had clustered around a handful of distinct groups. In Europe there are only seven. The conclusion: almost everyone of native European descent, wherever they live in the world, can trace their ancestry back to one of seven women, the Seven Daughters of Eve. He has named them Ursula, Xenia, Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine and Jasmine. In this remarkable scientific adventure story we learn exactly how our origins can be traced, how and where our ancient genetic ancestors lived, what their live were like and how we are each living proof of the almost miraculous strength of our DNA which has survived and prospered over so many thousands of years to reach us today. It is a book that not only presents the story of our evolution in a wholly new light, but also strikes right at the heart of ourselves as individuals and of our sense of identity.</p><p>is Professor of Human Genetics at the University of Oxford, has had a remarkable scientific career in genetics. After undertaking medical research into the causes of inherited bone disease, he set out to discover if DNA, the genetic material, could possibly survive in ancient bones. It did and he was the first to report on the recovery of ancient DNA from archaeological bone in the journal &#34;Nature&#34; in 1989. Since then Professor Sykes has been called in as the leading international authority to examine several high profile cases, such as the Ice Man, Cheddar Man and the many individuals claiming to be surviving members of the Russian Royal Family. Alongside this, he and his research team have over the last ten years compiled by far the most complete DNA family tree of our species yet seen.He has always emphasised the importance of the individual in shaping our genetic world. The website www.oxfordancestors.com offers people the chance to find out for themselves, from a DNA sample, where they fit in. As well as a scientist, Bryan Sykes has been a television news reporter and a parliamentary science adviser. He is the author of The Seven Daughters of Eve and Adam&#39;s Curse."A traveler from an antique land... lives within us all," claims Sykes, a professor of genetics at Oxford. This unique traveler is mitochondrial DNA, and, as this provocative account illustrates, it can help scientists and archeologists piece together the history of the human race. Mitochondrial DNA is present in every cell in the body, and it remains virtually unchanged (aside from random mutations) as it passes from mother to daughter. By quantifying and analyzing the mutations of this relatively stable circle of DNA, Sykes has solved some of the hottest debates about human origins. For example, he clarified a long-running debate among anthropologists over the original inhabitants of the Cook Islands. After retrieving mitochondrial DNA samples from the island natives, Sykes concluded that the natives emigrated from Asia, not America, as many Western anthropologists had contended. In a similar manner, Sykes analyzed samples from native Europeans to determine that modern humans are not at all related to Neanderthals. The book's most complex and controversial find that the ancient European hunter-gatherers predominated over the farmers and not vice versa leads Sykes to another stunning conclusion: by chance, nearly all modern Europeans are descendants of one of seven "clan mothers" who lived at different times during the Ice Age. Drawing upon archeological and climatic records, Sykes spins seven informative and gracefully imagined tales of how these "daughters of Eve" eked out a living on the frozen plains. (July 9)Forecast: Sykes is a bit of a celebrity geneticist, as he was involved in identifying the remains of the last Romanovs. This fame, plus his startling conclusions augmented by a five-city tour should generate publicity and sales among science, archeology and genealogy buffs.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Locked Room</h2><p>A woman robs a bank.

The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.</p><p>"The best way to understand the dramatic transformation of unknown books into bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or the phenomena of word of mouth or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life," writes Malcolm Gladwell, "is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do." Although anyone familiar with the theory of memetics will recognize this concept, Gladwell's <i>The Tipping Point</i> has quite a few interesting twists on the subject.<p> For example, Paul Revere was able to galvanize the forces of resistance so effectively in part because he was what Gladwell calls a "Connector": he knew just about everybody, particularly the revolutionary leaders in each of the towns that he rode through. But Revere "wasn't just the man with the biggest Rolodex in colonial Boston," he was also a "Maven" who gathered extensive information about the British. He knew what was going on and he knew exactly whom to tell. The phenomenon continues to this day--think of how often you've received information in an e-mail message that had been forwarded at least half a dozen times before reaching you.</p><p> Gladwell develops these and other concepts (such as the "stickiness" of ideas or the effect of population size on information dispersal) through simple, clear explanations and entertainingly illustrative anecdotes, such as comparing the pedagogical methods of <i>Sesame Street</i> and <i>Blue's Clues</i>, or explaining why it would be even easier to play Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon with the actor Rod Steiger. Although some readers may find the transitional passages between chapters hold their hands a little too tightly, and Gladwell's closing invocation of the possibilities of social engineering sketchy, even chilling, <i>The Tipping Point</i> is one of the most effective books on science for a general audience in ages. It seems inevitable that "tipping point," like "future shock" or "chaos theory," will soon become one of those ideas that everybody knows--or at least knows by name. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>Malcolm Gladwell is also the author of the #1 bestselling &#34;Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. &#34;He was a reporter for the &#34;Washington Post&#34; from 1987 to 1996, working first as a science writer and then as New York City bureau chief.

At the Pilgrims&#39; first Thanksgiving in 1621, chief among the honored guests was Massasoit, the sachem of the Wampanoag. Fifty-five years later, in 1676, colonial soldiers would walk through Plymouth with their horrible spoils of war: the severed head of Massasoit&#39;s son, King Philip, on a stake. Philip had just been shot at the end of a bloody conflict in which at least 10 percent of the colonists had been killed and half their towns destroyed. The Native Americans suffered even more in their pivotal struggle against the English. Less than a generation after King Philip&#39;s death, devastated by disease and famine and thousands slain or sold into slavery, the native peoples of New England were all but gone. Three hundred years later, their fight for freedom is all but erased from the history books. King Philip&#39;s Indian War provides insight into a dark and formative period of America&#39;s past, being both an in-depth history and a guide to the sites where the great ambushes, raids, and bloody battles took place. What the colonists learned from the native warriors in the swamps and woods of New England would prove invaluable in their own fight for freedom 100 years later, and the colonist&#39;s retaliation for the war would become the model for how Americans would treat Native Americans for the next three centuries. Includes first-person accounts by Mary Rowlandson, Benjamin Church, and Captain Wheeler.</p><p>Now largely forgotten, the massacres of 1675 to 1676, known as King Philip's War, ended the harmonious relations that had existed between native Americans and the colonists since their arrival at Plymouth Rock in 1620. Tensions had been rising as the number of settlers grew, and the pillaging of an outlying farm by affronted young braves escalated into open hostilities. Pitched battles were fought from Rhode Island to Maine. Hundreds of English died as farmers fled and cowered behind stockades or in the few port towns. Thousands of natives were slaughtered and the rest dispersed or sold into slavery in the West Indies. The savagery resulted in the clearing of the native populations from southern New England and the unopposed expansion of the New England colonies. It also became the brutal model on which the United States came to deal with its native peoples. <i>King Philip's War</i> tells the story with such close attention to detail that each ambush, each burned-out farm, becomes a vivid image. The authors make abundant use of maps and photographs of old sites to enable the reader to follow the course of the war: the book forms an exhaustive guide for the armchair historian or anyone wishing to visit the monuments and battlefields today. The terror and bitterness of the period live again in the book's illustrations of old woodcuts and lithographs and in quotations from contemporary narratives. That King Philip, whose head was paraded around the streets of Plymouth in a barbarous show of triumph, was the son of the Wampanoag chief who celebrated the first Thanksgiving with the Pilgrims in 1621 adds to the irony and tragedy of the events, whose memory this well-researched book deservedly keeps alive. <i>--John Stevenson</i>Eric B.

A Federation science summit is being held on Deep Space Station M-20 in two days; senior science officers and engineers from most of the ships in the quadrant are expected to attend, as well as several top Federation research scientists. </i></p><p><i> Dr. McCoy and the medical staff have begun their biannual physical workups for each crew member; I expect his initial report within the week.</i> </p><p><br> On the bridge of the <i>Enterprise,</i> Captain James T. Kirk sat back in his chair, glad that he wouldn't have to endure yet another physical. It often seemed as if he had to go the rounds with McCoy's machinery every month or so, and as often as he ended up getting knocked around, being prodded and poked one more time wasn't high on his list of things to do. He'd been thoroughly checked out after the trouble with the interphase phenomenon and the Tholians only a few weeks ago, and Bones had declared him fit as a fiddle. </p><p> <i>Well, except for being overworked,</i> Kirk thought, gazing absently at the stars coursing by on the main viewscreen, passing at a leisurely warp four. Undoubtedly one of the constants in McCoy's reports -- Bones loved to point out that the captain of the <i>Enterprise</i> needed to schedule himself a real vacation, or something dramatic and terrible might happen. Kirk liked to point out in turn that the ship's chief medical officer hadn't taken one in just as long, but Bones somehow managed to avoid hearing that part. The man was as stubborn as stubborn got. </p><p> Kirk smiled, just a little; one had to admire his tenacity, anyway. The science conference might allow both of them a break, at least for a couple of days; the main theme was to be the Federation's development of alternative power sources, much better suited to Spock or Scotty's area of interest than either of their own. Even at warp four they'd arrive a half day early, and technically, there would be nothing they <i>had</i> to do...however Bones felt about it, Kirk knew that a change of scenery would do him some good, not to mention a few reunions he was looking forward to -- he wasn't sure about Commodore Mendez, but thought that Bob Wesley's ship was in the sector, and had heard that Gage Darres was assigned to M-20. It would be nice to see a few familiar faces -- </p><p> "Captain, I'm picking up a signal from a Federation ship..." </p><p> Behind him, Lieutenant Uhura's voice was as cool and collected as always, but with a thread of tension that snapped Kirk out of his meandering reverie. </p><p> "...it's the automated distress call of the <i>U.S.S. Sphinx,</i> condition red, disaster status," Uhura said, and Kirk was on his feet. At his station, Spock's hands were already moving, adjusting the ship's sensors to seek out the vessel. </p><p> The automated disaster signal only kicked in when there was no one to stop it from kicking in. Kirk quickly ran through the most likely possibilities as Uhura accessed stats, not liking any of them -- <i>Plague. Hostile takeover. Antimatter breach. Another damned planet killer... </i></p><p><i> "U.S.S. Sphinx,</i> Centaurus-class starship, Captain Jack Casden commanding," Uhura said. </p><p> "How many aboard?" Kirk asked, unable to deny a small measure of relief. Centaurus vessels were primarily used for either scout or ambassadorial transport, occasionally as scientific surveyors, though not as processors; they were built for speed, and were among the smallest of the Federation's warp-capable ships. A Centaurus-class couldn't carry more than a hundred people. </p><p> "Crew list is thirty-seven, sir." </p><p> "Speed and bearing?" Kirk asked, stepping forward to look over Sulu's shoulder. </p><p> "It's traveling at...warp seven, from the Lantaru sector," Sulu said. "Headed 221 mark 35." </p><p> <i>Damn.</i> It was more or less aimed at a cluster of Federation civilian colonies in the Ramatis system, less than an hour away at that speed. </p><p> "Can you open a channel?" Kirk asked, turning to look at Uhura. She held her earpiece in place with one hand, deftly manipulating her station's receptors with the other. </p><p> "Negative, sir. Subspace arrays aren't receiving." </p><p> Bent over his station, Spock read off information from his console. "I'm picking up evidence of expelled warp plasma and debris trailing behind the ship." Spock straightened, turning to face him. "Captain, the <i>Sphinx</i> is in an increasing acceleration pattern. It is now traveling at warp eight, and will reach warp nine in three minutes, twenty-two seconds at its current rate of increase." </p><p> The Centaurus-class was made to be fast, but not that fast. She was damaged and dangerously out of control. Without knowing the status of the crew, they couldn't afford to risk damaging the ship any further -- but they also couldn't let it get much closer to the heavily populated Ramatis system. She'd blow up before she reached it, but God only knew what was on board. </p><p> Kirk stepped to his chair, aware that he also couldn't afford to waste time considering the possibilities. It had been less than a minute since Uhura had reported the distress signal, but allowing another moment to pass without acting could mean death for Captain Casden and the people on his ship. If they were even alive; there was no way to scan for life signs without getting closer. </p><p> <i>We have to get them out of warp, now.</i> A dozen half-formed thoughts darted through his deliberation before one evolved into an idea. </p><p> "Mr. Spock, assuming we can match their velocity, would it be possible to use the tractor beam to slow them down?" Kirk asked. </p><p> "It's possible, but it would have to be an exact match," Spock said. "Even a slight variance -- " </p><p> "Mr. Chekov, lay in a parallel course," Kirk said, having heard all he needed to hear. It was a plan, simple but better than none at all, and if anyone could pull it off, his people could. "Mr. Spock, Mr. Sulu, I want you to coordinate with Mr. Scott, we're going to try and ease her out of subspace. Lieutenant, keep trying to raise them." </p><p> Kirk sat down as he spoke, barely hearing the acknowledgments around him, already hitting the chair's com with his right fist. </p><p> "Kirk to engineering. Scotty, we've got a situation." </p><p><br> "You want me to <i>what?"</i> </p><p> Standing next to the wall com with one hand on the switch, Scotty felt the too-familiar knot of anxiety and disbelief hit his gut and take hold, the captain's urgent explanation still ringing in his ears. Good Lord, what did he think the <i>Enterprise</i> was made out of, neutronium? </p><p> "You heard me. Spock's sending the numbers down now, and helm is standing by." </p><p> Scotty shook his head, the pulsing lights of the reaction chamber making his shadow spin at his feet. "Captain, I can get her up to speed, but there's no way to maintain it, not if you mean to use the tractor beam to -- " </p><p> "Yes, I know, it's impossible," Kirk snapped. "And the longer you wait, the worse it's going to get. Do whatever it takes, Mr. Scott, but do it <i>now."</i> </p><p> "Aye, sir, Scott out," Scotty said, turning to look at Grant and Washburn, seeing the same pained concern on their faces that he knew was on his own. It was just the three of them in main engineering, had been since lunch. Tam and Dixon were running diagnostics on the impulse drive and Celaux wasn't coming on for another half hour. </p><p> "You heard him, lads. Mr. Washburn, line up Mr. Spock's ratios and plug them in, then sit on the reaction chamber, watch for flux. And call in Celaux when you're done, put her on overrides and secondaries." </p><p> Scotty strode toward the warp-engine monitors deciding what they could spare, talking to Grant over his shoulder. "We're going to siphon from the phaser-bank reserves for the tractor beam.

His intention was to destroy Britain through a total blockade, the Continental System. But Tsar Alexander of Russia now refused to apply the blockade, and Napoleon decided to bring him to heel.; Napoleon quickly realised that nemesis awaited him, and the events of 1812 had a colossal impact on the fate of Europe: a great patriotic surge helped turn the Russians into a nation (hence Tchaikovsky&#39;s &#39;1812&#39; overture) and led them to reject Western values; the Germans began their fateful &#39;Prussification&#39;; the French lost their cultural dominance.</p><p>Adam Zamoyski was born in New York, was educated at Oxford, and lives in London.

Yet, when he is struck ill shortly after they arrive in the city of Reggen, Saville must don boy's clothes in the hopes of gaining a commission from the king to keep them fed. The kingdom is soon on edge when stories spread of an army of giants led by a man who cannot be killed. But giants are just stories, and no man is immortal. <br> <br> And then the giants do come to the city gates, two larger-than-life scouts whom Saville cunningly tricks into leaving. The Tailor of Reggen is the hero of the kingdom, the king promises his sister's hand in marriage, and by the time Saville reaches the palace doors, it is widely known that the Tailor single-handedly killed the giants. When her secret&#x2015;that she's a girl&#x2015;is quickly discovered by Lord Galen Verras, the king's cousin, Saville's swept into the twists and turns of court politics. <br> <br> The deathless man is very real, and he will use his giant army to ensure he is given the throne freely or by force. Now, only a tailor girl with courage and cunning can see beyond the tales to discover the truth and save the kingdom again. <br> <br> Debut author Sarah McGuire artfully crafts a story of understanding, identity, and fighting to protect those you love most in <em>Valiant</em>, a rich reimagining of "The Brave Little Tailor."</p></p><p><p><strong>Sarah McGuire</strong> lives within sight of Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains, where she teaches high school creative writing and math classes with very interesting word problems.</p><p>"Seventeen-year-old Saville is trapped. Arriving in the city of Reggen, Saville's father, a tailor, falls ill. Despite her father's disdain for her, she resourcefully dons boy's clothing, chops her hair, and assumes the name Avi. Then she has to be smarter than ever when she must rescue a friend&#x2015;and the city&#x2015;from two giants. The town cheers Avi as their champion, and stories of his victory turn into impossible feats of human ability. Problems continue to arise as saving Reggen from an evil duke becomes as much Saville's destiny as it is Lord Verras', the king's cousin with whom Saville falls in love. This reinvention and expansion of Grimm's fairy tale 'The Valiant Little Tailor' replaces the protagonist with his giant-battling daughter. <strong>Featuring a strong, brave, and determined female protagonist, royalty, and giants, it's a debut novel that's perfect for fans of Shannon Hale and Gail Carson Levine.

After her mother's death, 17-year-old Saville accompanies her gruff father to the village of Reggen, where he will start up his tailoring business anew. When he is felled by an apoplexy, Saville dresses as a boy, calls herself Avi, and takes on the guise of her father's apprentice. The ruse plays on even after Avi outwits two giants who were scouting Reggen for their mysterious leader, a duke who claims to be an heir of the ancient emperor and 'holder of the eternal heart.' But when the village learns the true identity of its supposed giant-slaying champion, and an army of raging giants approaches, Saville finds unlikely allies (and romance) as she takes on her next challenge. McGuire crafts a richly detailed cast, and <strong>her heroine brings verve to a familiar story</strong>.

Her relationships are compelling, sympathetic, and realistically flawed. The city of Reggen is drawn beautifully, captivating the reader's imagination.

Saville, a tailor's daughter, picks up the ruined pieces of her family's livelihood after her father suffers an apoplexy that leaves him unable to speak, let alone sew. She masquerades as a boy to secure a commission from the king. Nearby villages have suffered attacks by giants led by a duke who describes himself as 'Heir to the Ancient Emperor's crown, Holder of the Eternal Heart.' When two giants appear at the city's gates, Saville sees Will, a waif she's taken under her wing, dangling from their hands. Like the tailor in the Grimms' folk tale, Saville outwits the giants and is declared champion by the king&#x2015;who promises his sister's hand in marriage to the champion before finding out who she is. Saville uses her ingenuity to get both self and city out of trouble, with the help of a handsome young nobleman and Will. McGuire uses familiar European folk-tale motifs as the bare-bones backdrop for a lively adventure story with some surprising twists. <strong>Characters are fully developed through Saville's engaging first-person voice, but it's clever Saville herself who wins the day&#x2015;and the heart of the nobleman.

And everyone, finally, was welcome-to come as themselves. This is not a fairy tale. This was real, mighty real, and disco sensation Sylvester was the piper. Joshua Gamson-a Yale-trained pop culture expert-uses him, a boy who would be fabulous, to lead us through the story of the '70s when a new era of change liberated us from conformity and boredom. Gamson captures the exuberant life, feeling, energy, and fun of a generation's wonderful, magical waking up-from the parties to the dancing and music.<br> <br>The story begins with a little black boy who started with nothing but a really big voice. We follow him from the Gospel chorus to the glory days in the Castro where a generation shook off its shame as Sylvester sang and began his rise as part of a now-notorious theatrical troup called the Cockettes. Celebrity, sociology, and music history mingle and merge around this endlessly entertaining story of a singer who embodied the freedom, spirit, and flamboyance of a golden moment in American culture.<br></p><p>Joshua Gamson is a professor of sociology at the University of San Francisco. He is the author of <i>Freaks Talk Back: Tabloid Talk Shows and Sexual Nonconformity</i> and <i>Claims to Fame: Celebrity in Contemporary America.</i> He formerly taught at Yale. He lives in Oakland, California.<br>In the world of that most disparaged of musical genres&#x2014;disco&#x2014;the subject of this biography commanded respect. By conventional standards, Sylvester James was an outsider&#x2014;he was an out, gay, African-American who dressed in drag and sang with a thundering falsetto&#x2014;but he found mainstream success in the late 1970s and early '80s with three Top 40 hits, <i>Dance (Disco Heat), You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)</i> and <i>I Who Have Nothing</i>, and an international #1 sensation (<i>Do Ya Wanna Funk</i>). At times, Gamson's (<i>Freaks Talk Back</i>) extensively researched volume is a vibrant and moving oral biography, with firsthand conversations with virtually everyone who knew or worked with Sylvester, from his youth in South Central L.A. through his successful music career, to his death from AIDS in 1988 at 41. The richness of this material (Sylvester's background singers Martha Wash and Izora Rhodes Armstead, who later became the Weather Girls, are particularly amusing and insightful raconteurs) reveals all the shadings of Sylvester's diva persona: he was fierce but generous, caustic but caring, temperamental but talented. Gamson's pulsating use of song lyrics, sounds and descriptions also creates a tangible history of San Francisco as it changed from a joyous oasis of liberation to the epicenter of the AIDS pandemic. Seventeen years after his death, this gay icon gets the celebratory biography he deserves. Photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When a hurricane shuts down production at a Unilever plant? When Dell and Apple chip manufacturers in Taiwan take weeks to recover from an earthquake? When the U.S. Pacific ports are shut down during the Christmas rush? When terrorists strike? In The Resilient Enterprise, Yossi Sheffi shows that companies' fortunes in the face of such business shocks depend more on choices made before the disruption than they do on actions taken in the midst of it&#x2014;and that resilience benefits firms every day, disaster or no disaster. He shows how companies can build in flexibility throughout their supply chains, based on proven design principles and the right culture&#x2014;balancing security, redundancy, and short-term profits. And he shows how investments in resilience and flexibility not only reduce risk but create a competitive advantage in the increasingly volatile marketplace.<br> <br> Sheffi describes the way companies can increase security&#x2014;reducing the likelihood of a disruption&#x2014;with layered defenses, the tracking and analysis of &#x201c;near-misses,&#x201d; fast detection, and close collaboration with government agencies, trading partners, and even competitors. But the focus of the book is on resilience&#x2014;the ability to bounce back from disruptions and disasters&#x2014;by building in redundancy and flexibility. For example, standardization, modular design, and collaborative relationships with suppliers (and other stakeholders) can help create a robust supply chain. And a corporate culture of flexibility&#x2014;with distributed decision making and communications at all levels&#x2014;can create a resilient enterprise.<br> <br> Sheffi provides tools for companies to reduce the vulnerability of the supply chain they live in. And along the way he tells the stories of dozens of enterprises, large and small, including Toyota, Nokia, General Motors, Zara, Land Rover, Chiquita, Aisin Seiki, Southwest Airlines, UPS, Johnson and Johnson, Intel, Amazon.com, the U.S. Navy, and others, from across the globe. Their successes, failures, preparations, and methods provide a rich set of lessons in preparing for and managing disruptions.<br> Additional material available at www.TheResilientEnterprise.com</p><p>"The Resilient Enterprise is more than a grab bag of stories about fires, thieves, and tornadoes. It is the timely analysis of an important--and overlooked aspect of business strategy. Mr. Sheffi argues that crisis control can be a competitive advantage for companies that get it right.

The ability of Harris's detective, Sebastian St. Cyr, the Viscount Devlin, to mingle freely with the cream of society leads to his receiving a highly sensitive commission. Given the perilous state of the English monarchy in 1811, the discovery of the dissolute Prince Regent with a murder victim in his arms makes the death of the beautiful young wife of an aristocrat even more scandalous. St. Cyr is charged by the powers that be with solving the crime and absolving the royal suspect. The author deftly combines political intrigue, cleverly concealed clues and vivid characters for a fast-moving story that will have readers eagerly anticipating future volumes in the series. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is also the center of ongoing conflict about the best use of natural resources, as the federal government, Indian nations, and ever-growing municipalities struggle to obtain control of water, minerals, and rangeland. As a former natural-resources attorney and now professor of law at the University of Colorado, Charles Wilkinson knows that struggle well, and his new book provides an on-the-ground overview of some of the most pressing conflicts. Some of his fieldnotes will come as no surprise to Westerners and students of the environment; others come as eye-opening news, whether the fact that Navajo Indian children are regularly bused to schools far away from home, traveling as much as 150 miles a day, or that radioactive waste and fallout from cold-war mining and testing remains a critical danger to public health across the plateau. Wilkinson's findings are often depressing; as he writes, "Thirty-five years ago I saw the West as clean and fresh, open and uncluttered. I no longer see it that way. I love it still, with all my heart, but I fear for it. For it is aging rapidly." Even so, he offers a few success stories to temper the bad news, notably the hard-won designation of large sections of the plateau as protected wilderness, with the promise of more extensive protection to come. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><p>Charles Wilkinson is Moses Lasky Professor of Law at the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado.

After his daughter is brutally murdered, a revenge-seeking Marcus Connelly leaves Memphis on a hunt across America's hobo camps and ghost towns for the grotesquely scarred, ghostly figure known as "Mr. Shivers." On his quest Connelly teams up with a scrappy band of hobos recovering from their own brushes with "the gray man," and the body count increases as they ride the rails tracking their target. Connelly's spiraling bloodlust begins to rival Shivers's, threatening to take more than just his family and friends away from him. Sprinkled with hobo folklore, Bennett's supernatural dust storm of a debut offers a killer premise and may remind readers of vintage Stephen King. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i>Robert Jackson Bennett was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Braiding three strands into one rich narrative, John Ferling brings these American icons down from their pedestals to show them as men of flesh and blood, and gives us a new understanding of the passion and uncertainty of the struggle to form a new nation.<br> A leading historian of the Revolutionary era, Ferling draws on an unsurpassed command of the primary sources and a talent for swiftly moving narrative to give us intimate views of each of these men. More than any scholar before him, Ferling shows us both the overarching historical picture of the era and a gripping sense of how these men encountered the challenges that faced them. At close quarters, we see Washington, containing a profound anger at British injustice within an austere demeanor; Adams, far from home, struggling with severe illness and French duplicity in his crucial negotiations in Paris; and Jefferson, distracted and indecisive, confronting uncertainties about his future in politics. John Adams, in particular, emerges from the narrative as the most underappreciated hero of the Revolution, while Jefferson is revealed as the most overrated of the Founders, although the most eloquent.<br> <em>Setting the World Ablaze</em> shows in dramatic detail how these conservative men--successful members of the colonial elite--were transformed into radical revolutionaries, and in doing so, it illuminates not just the special genius of these three leaders, but the remarkable transformation of His Majesty's colonies into the United States.<br></p><p><i>Setting the World Ablaze</i> is the story of the three men who, perhaps more than any others, helped bring the United States into being: George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson. Weaving their three life stories into one narrative, John E. Ferling delivers a genuine and intimate illustration of them and, in doing so, gives us a new understanding of the passion and uncertainty of the struggle to form a new nation.<p> The three sections of Ferling's study chronologically examine major epochs in the lives of the three men: youth and early adulthood, the years surrounding the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and finally, defeat of the British in the Revolutionary War. Through the medium of comparative biography, <i>Setting the World Ablaze</i> attempts to link personal and impersonal elements in the contours of the American Revolution and the war that accompanied it. A professor of History at the State University of West Georgia and a leading scholar of the Revolutionary era, Ferling draws on a firm command of primary sources and his own expertise of the period to examine fundamental issues critical to our understanding of Washington, Adams, and Jefferson, as well as of the historical period. He abandons the standard iconography and focuses instead on what motivated and inspired these three men as human beings. For example, what forces shaped each of the three during his youth, what was each like as a mature young man before public affairs and fame changed everything, and what determined their behavior as activists? John Adams emerges from the narrative as the most underappreciated hero of the Revolution, while Jefferson is revealed as the most eloquent but also most overrated of the Founders. Personal anecdotes from all periods of their lives add to Ferling's already rich portrait and give the reader a unique sense of how Washington, Adams, and Jefferson negotiated the many challenges they encountered throughout their lives. <i>--Bertina Loeffler Sedlack</i></p><br><strong>John Ferling</strong> is Professor of History at the State University of West Georgia and the author of <em>John Adams: A Life</em> and <em>The First of Men: A Life of George Washington.</em> He lives in Carrollton, Georgia.<br></p><h2>A Performer&#39;s Guide to Seventeenth-Century Music, Second Edition (Publications of the Early Music Institute)</h2><p><p>Revised and expanded, <i>A Performer&#x2019;s Guide to Seventeenth Century Music</i> is a comprehensive reference guide for students and professional musicians.

Instead it creeps into the shadows cast by those institutions, concentrating on artists like Jim Dickinson and Alex Chilton, and bands like the MarKeys and Big Star. Gordon limns, with respect and the fascination born of true devotion, the story of white teenagers caught in the middle of an extraordinary confluence of music, entrepreneurship, to usher in an exciting new musical form. The result is a rock 'n' roll and Memphis -- its alma mater.</p><p>Perhaps no other city in America has provided more grist for the music sociology mill than Memphis, Tennessee. While Memphis has been the muse for some truly classic books (Peter Guralnick's Sweet Soul Music, to name just one), the rhetoric surrounding "The Birthplace of Rock &amp; Roll"--also "The Home of the Blues"--can be as daunting as a walk down the ravenously gentrified blues theme park that is Beale Street. <p> Enter Robert Gordon, a Memphis native and keen chronicler of the city's secret history. Gordon's <i>It Came from Memphis</i> all but ignores the Bluff City's oft-cited musical hierarchy--B.B. King, Elvis, Al Green et al.--in favor of its great unheralded eccentrics. You might not be familiar with the Insect Trust or Mudboy and the Neutrons, but Gordon argues--with empathy and wit--that you should be. </p><p> But music is only part of the story here. Whether it's Memphis's wrestling legend Sputnik Monroe, or the city's esoteric patron saint, artist-professor John McIntire, Gordon's shrewd eye sees the mojo in them all. In a way, Gordon's book is even more vital than the classic volumes on Memphis music that predate it. Where Guralnick interprets a musical tradition that is already firmly embedded in the American psyche, Gordon gives voice to a clandestine tradition that otherwise might go forgotten. <i>--Matt Hanks</i></p><i>Robert Gordon</i> has written for major music publications in the United States and England, and has contributed to several books.

Our capacity to make sense of the world and the fact that we pass our lives steeped in knowledge and understanding, albeit incomplete, that far exceeds what we are or even experience have challenged our greatest thinkers for centuries.<br><br>In <i>Logos</i>, Raymond Tallis steps into the gap between mind and world to explore what is at stake in our attempts to make sense of our world and our lives. With his characteristic combination of scholarly rigor and lively humor he reveals how philosophers, theologians, and scientists have sought to demystify our extraordinary capacity to understand the world by collapsing the distance between the mind that does the sense-making and the world that is made sense of. Such strategies&#x2015;whether by locating the world inside the mind, or making the mind part of the world&#x2015;are shown to be deeply flawed and of little help in explaining the intelligibility of the world. Indeed, it is the <i>distance</i> that we need, argues Tallis, if knowledge is to count as knowledge and for there to be a distinction between the knower and the known.<br><br>Tallis brings his formidable analysis to bear on the many challenges we face when trying to make sense of our sense-making. These include the idea of cognitive progress, which presupposes a benchmark of complete understanding; cognitive completion, which unites the separate strands of our understanding (from the laws of nature to our ineluctable everyday understanding of things, incorporating the meanings we live by); and the knowing subject&#x2015;us&#x2015;with our partial and limited viewpoint mediated by our bodies.<br><br>The book showcases Tallis&#x2019;s enviable knack of making tricky philosophical arguments cogent and engaging to the non-specialist and his remarkable ability to help us see humankind more clearly. For anyone who has shared Einstein&#x2019;s observation that &#x201c;the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility,&#x201d; the book will be fascinating and insightful reading.</p><p>Raymond Tallis trained in medicine at Oxford University and at St Thomas&#x2019; Hospital London before becoming professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Manchester. He was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences for his research in clinical neuroscience and he has played a key role in developing guidelines for the care of stroke patients in the UK.

Aphrodite Jones takes the reader into the world of several teenage girls in small-town southern Indiana--their clothes, rock music, and fascination with offbeat spirituality, and also their lesbian jealousies and penchant for violence. This book provides a useful balance to an earlier account by Michael Quinlan (<i>Little Lost Angel</i>).

At the heart of it all is Alma, the fiddler whose song and quiet spirit wend their way into Clay's heart, saving him just as he approaches the brink of despair. Together, they help Clay to fashion a life from what treasured pieces are around him and to see the family that has been right beside him all along.</p><p> Authentic, honest, and moving, <i>Clay's Quilt</i> is both the story of a young man's journey and of Appalachian people struggling to hold on to their heritage.</p><p></p>Advance Praise for <i>Clay's Quilt</i><p> "One of the best books I have ever read about contemporary life in the mountains of Southern Appalachia, a region I know well.

Covering political, economic, cultural, and social history, and combining hundreds of short descriptive entries with longer evaluative articles, the encyclopedia is informative, engaging, and a pleasure to read. The Reader&#39;s Companion is sponsored by the Society of American Historians, an organization dedicated to promoting literary excellence in the writing of biography and history. Under the editorship of the eminent historians John A. Garraty and Eric Foner, a large and distinguished group of scholars, biographers, and journalists -- nearly four hundred contemporary authorities -- illuminate the critical events, issues, and individuals that have shaped our past. More than a reference book to be consulted simply for the dates or details of an event, the Companion offers a history of ideas. It distinguishes itself from conventional encylcopedias by featuring several hundred thematic articles. A chronological account of immigration, for example, is complemented by a conceptual article on ethnicity. Similarly, the Bull Moose party and the Know-Nothings, examined in individual entries, are also placed within a larger context in an article on third parties in American politics. And readers consulting entries on specific religious groups, leaders, and movements will be led to an article offering an overview of religion in America. Linking discrete facts, dates, and events through its interpretive essays, the Reader&#39;s Companion presents the overarching themes and ideas that have animated our historical landscape. Over the past twenty years, the study of history has undergone a metamorphosis. Political history, once the primary avenue for exploring the past, has given way to the &#34;new social history.&#34; Focus has shifted from key events and leaders to everyday life in America, including the history of the family, women and the work force, race relations, and community life. The Reader&#39;s Companion to American History reflects this broader vision of our past. Interweaving traditional political and economic topics with the spectrum of America&#39;s social and cultural legacies -- everything from marriage to medicine, crime to baseball, fashion to literature -- the Companion is certain to engage the curiosity, interests, and passions of every reader.</p><p>Like an encyclopedia, <i>The Reader's Companion to American History</i> contains alphabetical entries for almost every important person, place, or event in America's past. Unlike an encyclopedia, however, this lively interpretive volume is meant to be read and enjoyed, not merely used as a reference. It contains three different kinds of articles: short, unsigned listings similar to those found in most encyclopedias; signed biographical pieces by historical authorities; and longer essays on broad topics such as abolitionism or 20th-century art. Each article cross-references related topics, and an extensive index opens up webs of interrelationships, making it possible to delve deeply into areas of special interest. Accessible, comprehensive, and surprisingly affordable, <i>The Reader's Companion to American History</i> merits an important place in any home library.John A. Garraty is the Gourverneur Morris Professor Emeritus of History at Columbia University and a former president of the Society of American Historians. His publications include Unemployment in History, The New Commonwealth, The Great Depression, and numerous history textbooks. He was an editor of the Columbia History of the World and the editor of recent supplements of the Dictionary of American Biography. He is currently the editor of the multivolume American National Biography.</p><h2>Eric</h2><p>1st large illustrated Gollancz 1990 paperback, vg++ In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>Sir Terry Pratchett is a publishing phenomenon. Among his many prizes and citations are the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award, the Carnegie Medal, the BSFA Award, eight honorary doctorates and, of course, a knighthood. In 2012, he won a BAFTA for his documentary on the subject of assisted suicide, &#39;Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die&#39;. He is the author of fifty bestselling books but is best known for the globally renowned Discworld series. The first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was published in 1983, and the series is still going strong almost three decades later. Four Discworld novels - Hogfather, Going Postal, The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic - have been adapted for television, with more to follow. His books have sold approximately 85 million copies worldwide (but who&#39;s counting?), and been translated into thirty-seven languages. In 2007, Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer&#39;s Disease. He died in 2015.The latest in Pratchett's Discworld series plays a variation on the Faust theme. Eric is a singularly inept sorcerer who conjures up an even more inept wizard, Rincewind, and a sentient (also treacherous, vindictive, and unruly) footlocker named, of course, the Luggage. Not having got anything like what he bargained for, Eric is fated to go through the usual zany ordeals of a Pratchett protagonist, until he wishes he'd never been born. Nor do things really all work out in the end, even if Eric is better off than he expected to be through most of the book. The Discworld books are building a following that is beginning to resemble that of Piers Anthony's Xanth stories, although it can be said that Pratchett is rather more sophisticated than Anthony. In any case, there should be a lot of readers for this one. Fantasy collections, provide accordingly. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Rape: A Love Story (Otto Penzler Books)</h2><p>Teena Maguire should not have tried to shortcut her way home that Fourth of July. Not after midnight, not through Rocky Point Park. Not the way she was dressed: tank top, denim cut-offs, high-heeled sandals. Not with her twelve-year-old daughter, Bethie. Not with packs of local guys running loose on hormones, rage, and alcohol. A victim of gang rape, left for dead in the park boathouse, the once vital and sexy Teena Maguire can now only regret that she has survived. And Bethie can barely remember a childhood uncolored by fear. For they&#x2019;re not even a neighborhood away, the men that she identified for the Niagara Falls Police Department: the wide-browed, sandy-haired Pick brothers; the sneering Jimmy DeLucca; Fritz Haaber with his moustache and stubbled jaw. They&#x2019;ve killed her grandmother&#x2019;s longhaired orange cat. At a relentless, compelling pace punctuated by lonely cries in the night and the whisper of terror in the afternoon, National Book Award-winner Joyce Carol Oates unfolds the story of Teena and Bethie, their assailants, and their unexpected, silent champion, a man who knows the meaning of justice. And love.</p><p>Joyce Carol Oates is the author of more than 70 books, including novels, short story collections, plays, poetry volumes, and criticisms. She has been awarded both the National Book Award and the PEN/Malamud Award and has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. She lives in Princeton, New Jersey.Prolific Oates (We Were the Mulvaneys; Beast; etc.) explores sexual violence and its aftermath in this taut, harrowing novella. Teena Maguire, a pretty, 30-something widow, is on her way home from a party when she is beaten, gang-raped and left for dead. She survives the attack, which her 12-year-old daughter Bethie witnesses, but as only a husk of her former self ("That pathetic woman," she thinks of herself, "they should have finished the job"). It is to Bethie, then, that the task of caring for her falls: "If Momma could sleep, that was good. It was your duty to let her sleep." Oates draws on shifting, often fragmentary points of view to tell the story of the days before and after the rape, including that of Teena's lover, Ray Casey, whose feelings have changed since the attack; Walt Pick, the father of two of the rapists; Harriet Diebenkorn, the deputy prosecutor who fails Teena in the preliminary hearing; and Bethie, whose affecting chapters are written in the second person. Redemption of a sort is offered in the form of John Dromoor, a young police officer whose concern for Teena is matched by his desire for justice. When a slick Buffalo defense lawyer devastates Teena on the witness stand, Dromoor takes matters into his own hands. This is where the story truly chills, as the attackers fret about their future and Dromoor slowly exacts a cool vengeance. The love story is Bethie's-a haunting affection born of a terrible crime. The effects linger, despite the book's brevity. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is the question at the heart of this stunning new book. &#34;People seek therapy only when things have gone terribly wrong in their lives,&#34; observes Deborah Luepnitz, one of the field&#39;s most gifted psychotherapists and a writer of uncommon talent. &#34;They arrive in the grip of a death wish or some unspeakable obsession, but what is at stake always turns out to be intimacy-the endless dilemmas of loyalty and desire.&#34; Schopenhauer&#39;s Porcupines recounts five stories from Luepnitz&#39;s practice, with patients who range from the super-rich to the homeless-as they grapple with panic attacks, psychosomatic illness, marital despair, and sexual recklessness. We watch their therapy unfold week-to-week, from the first phone call to the final sessions, as these men and women learn, in the words of one poet, &#34;to make room in love for hate.&#34;Written with wry humor and deep compassion, Schopenhauer&#39;s Porcupines goes further than any other book in unveiling the secrets of &#34;how talking helps.&#34; Its wisdom and intelligence will appeal to readers everywhere who are reaching for psychological renewal and want to go beyond &#34;quick-fix&#34; cures.</p><p>Deborah Anna Luepnitz is on the Clinical Faculty of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.Throughout its history, psychological theory has contended that at least part of what can make maintaining intimate relationships so difficult is the conflict between feeling aggressive and loving toward the same person. Luepnitz, a psychotherapist and author of The Family Interpreted, finds a metaphor for this problem of intimacy in Schopenhauer's porcupine dilemma a story of how porcupines in winter must struggle between the desire to seek warmth from closeness with each other and the pain they feel from one another's quills as they become too close. Drawing from the writings of Winnicott, Lacan and Freud, along with case studies, Luepnitz not only provides insight into the practice of a wide range of psychotherapeutic treatments (such as couples therapy, family therapy and supportive psychotherapy), but also shows how psychotherapy can help people balance their conflicting feelings of love and hate via discourse and reflection. Written for a general audience, this book is enjoyable to read and nicely describes the treatment of a variety of patients, from an 11-year-old girl struggling to control stress-induced diabetes to a homeless woman dealing with poverty and a history of abusive relationships. Although such anecdotes cannot "prove" the validity of psychotherapeutic methods, Luepnitz's book does give those who may be curious or skeptical about "talk therapies" the opportunity to consider whether psychotherapy is right for them. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Models of Revelation</h2><p>Discusses the nature of revelation as doctrine, history, and inner experience, and examines its relationship to the Bible, eschatology, and other religions</p><p>Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J. is a distinguished scholar in residence at Fordham University, former president of the Catholic Theological Society of America, and the author of many books.

Secularism was rising, most notably in academia. Evolution&#x2013;and its catchphrase, &#x201c;survival of the fittest&#x201d;&#x2013;animated and guided this Gilded Age.<br><br>Darwin&#x2019;s theory of natural selection was extended to society and morals not by Darwin himself but by the English philosopher Herbert Spencer, father of &#x201c;the Law of Equal Freedom,&#x201d; which holds that &#x201c;every man is free to do that which he wills,&#x201d; provided it doesn&#x2019;t infringe on the equal freedom of others. As this justification took root as a social, economic, and ethical doctrine, Spencer won numerous influential American disciples and allies, including industrialist Andrew Carnegie, clergyman Henry Ward Beecher, and political reformer Carl Schurz. Churches, campuses, and newspapers convulsed with debate over the proper role of government in regulating Americans&#x2019; behavior, this country&#x2019;s place among nations, and, most explosively, the question of God&#x2019;s existence.<br><br>In late 1882, most of the main figures who brought about and popularized these developments gathered at Delmonico&#x2019;s, New York&#x2019;s most venerable restaurant, in an exclusive farewell dinner to honor Spencer and to toast the social applications of the theory of evolution. It was a historic celebration from which the repercussions still ripple throughout our society.<br><br><i>Banquet at Delmonico&#x2019;s</i> is social history at its finest, richest, and most appetizing, a brilliant narrative bristling with personal intrigue, tantalizing insights, and greater truths about American life and culture.</p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, January 2009</b>: <i>Banquet at Delmonico's</i> is a fascinating look at how the theory of evolution provided a much-needed challenge to 19th-century America. Although evolution itself was hardly a new concept--scholars had pondered transmutation and common descent for centuries--naturalist Charles Darwin ignited an intellectual bonfire during the 1860s with his hypothesis of natural selection. Author Barry Werth explains how the uproar reached far beyond the scientific community, as evolutionary ideas such as "survival of the fittest" (a phrase coined not by Darwin, but by English philosopher Herbert Spencer) became rallying cries for leaders in business, theology, and government. Steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie gushed that "light came as in a flood and all was clear" while reading the works of Darwin and Spencer, while preacher Henry Ward Beecher embraced his role as a "Christian evolutionist." With post-Civil War America growing increasingly uneasy over irreconcilable differences between the modern world and old truths of theology, Werth thoughtfully explores how a bold leap into a new school of thought rejuvenated a weary nation. - <i>Dave Callanan</i>Barry Werth is the author of <i>31 Days, The Scarlet Professor,</i> which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, <i>Damages</i>, and <i>The Billion-Dollar Molecule</i>.

After Mahler&#39;s death she married Walter Gropius, and stayed his wife throughout the years when he was founding the Bauhaus and revolutionizing the world of design. When she was fifty, she married Franz Werfel, author of The Song of Bernadette, The 40 Days of Musa Dagh, Jacobowsky and the Colonel, and much more. Alma was united in love, sexually or not, with Alexander von Zemlinsky, her music teacher and the only mentor ever recognized by Arnold Schoenberg; with Ossip Gabrilovitch, pianist and conductor; with Gerhart Hauptmann, the dramatist; and, most importantly, with the artist Oskar Kokoschka, who called her a &#34;wild brat&#34; on her seventieth birthday and wanted the love they shared to be immortalized for future generations. The daughter of a celebrated Viennese landscape painter, Alma grew up privileged, with a taste for luxury but not always with the money to support her tastes. Over the years, she accumulated country houses, a dwelling of landmark stature on a Venetian canal and a mansion in Vienna. She might have become an important composer; had she been born a century later, she could have been a conductor. As it was, she devoted her life to men whom she considered to be geniuses.</p><p></p><h2>Through Wolf&#39;s Eyes</h2><p><br>Firekeeper only vaguely remembers a time when she didn't live with her "family," a pack of "royal wolves"-bigger, stronger, and smarter than normal wolves. Now her pack leaders are sending her back to live among the humans, as they promised her mother years ago.<br><br>Some of the humans think she may be the lost heir to their throne. This could be good-and it could be very, very dangerous. In the months to come, learning to behave like a human will turn out to be more complicated than she'd ever imagined.<br><br>But though human ways might be stranger than anything found in the forest, the infighting in the human's pack is nothing Firekeeper hasn't seen before. That, she understands just fine. She's not your standard-issue princess-and this is not your standard-issue fairy tale.<br><br></p><p><br>Jane Lindskold lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She is the author of <i>Through Wolf&#x2019;s Eyes </i>and <i>Wolf&#x2019;s Head, Wolf&#x2019;s Heart</i> and several prior fantasy novels, including <i>Changer </i>and <i>Legends Walking</i>. With Roger Zelazny, she wrote <i>Lord Demon </i>and <i>Donnerjack.</i><br><br>I<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>AAA-ROOO! AAA-ROOO</i>!<br>Distant, yet carrying, the wolf's howl broke the late-afternoon stillness. In the depths of the forest, a young woman, as T strong and supple as the sound, rose noiselessly to her feet. With bloodstained fingers, she pushed her short, dark brown hair away from her ears to better hear the call.<br><i>Aaa-rooo! Aaa-rooo</i>!<br>It was a sentry howl, relayed from a great distance to the east. The young woman understood its message more easily than she would have understood any form of human speech.<br>"<i>Strangers! Strangers! Strangers! Strange</i>!"<br>The last lilt of inflection clarified the previous howls. Whatever was coming from the east was not merely a trespasser--perhaps a young wolf dispersing from his birth pack--but an unknown quantity. But from the relay signal that preceded the call, the strangers were far away.<br>The young woman felt a momentary flicker of curiosity. Hunger, however, was more pressing. The cold times were not long past and her memories of dark, freezing days, when even the stupid fish were unreachable beneath the ice, were sharp.<br>She squatted again and continued skinning a still warm rabbit, musing, not for the first time, how much more convenient it would be if she could eat it as her kinfolk did: fur, bone, flesh, and guts all in one luxurious mouthful.<br>* * *<br><i>AAA-ROOO! AAA-ROOO</i>!<br>Derian Carter, the youngest member of Earl Kestrel's expedition, felt his shoulder jerked nearly out of its socket when the wolf howl pierced the late-afternoon peace. The haunting sound startled the sensitive chestnut mare he was unbridling nearly out of her highly bred stockings.<br>"Easy, easy, Roanne," he murmured mechanically, all too aware that his own heart was racing. That wolf sounded <i>close</i>!<br>As Derian eased the mare's headstall over ears that couldn't seem to decide whether to prick in alarm or flatten in annoyance, he said in a voice he was pleased to discover remained calm, almost nonchalant:<br>"That sounds like a big wolf out there, Race."<br>Race Forester, the guide for Earl Kestrel's expedition, looked down his long nose at the younger man and chuckled. He was a lean fellow with a strong, steady tread that spoke of long distances traveled afoot and blond hair bleached so white by constant exposure to the sun that he would look much the same at sixty as he did at thirty.<br>"That it does, Derian." Race stroked his short but full beard as he glanced around their sheltered forest camp, systematically noting the areas that would need to be secured now that big predators were about. "Wolves always sound bigger when you're on their turf, rather than safe behind a city wall."<br>Derian swallowed a retort. In the weeks since Earl Kestrel's expedition had departed the capital of Hawk Haven, Race had rarely missed an opportunity to remind the members (other than the earl himself) that Race himself was the woodsman, while they were mere city folk. Only the fact that Race's contempt was so generally administered had kept Derian from calling him out and showing him that a city-bred man could know a thing or two.<br>Only that, Derian admitted honestly (though only to himself), and the fact that Race would probably turn Derian into a smear on the turf. Though Derian Carter was tall enough to need to duck his head going through low doorways, muscular enough to handle the most spirited horse or work from dawn to dusk loading and unloading wagons at his father's warehouses, there was something about Race Forester's sinewy form, about the way he carried his slighter build, that made Derian doubt who would be the winner in a hand-to-hand fight.<br>And, with another surge of honesty, Derian admitted that the woodsman had earned the right to express his contempt. Race was good at what he did--many said the best in both Hawk Haven and their rival kingdom of Bright Bay. What was Derian Carter in comparison? Well trained, but untried.<br>Derian would never have admitted that before they set out--knowing himself good with a horse or an account book or even with his fists--but a few things had been hammered into his red head since they left the capital, things that hadn't been all that much fun to learn, and Derian didn't plan on forgetting them now.<br>So Derian swallowed his retort and continued removing the tack from the six riding horses. To his right, burly Ox, his road-grown beard incongruously black against pink, round cheeks, was heaving the packs from the four mules. When another long, eerie wolf's howl caused the nearest mule to kick back at the imagined danger, Ox blocked the kick rather than dodging.<br>That block neatly summed up why Ox was a member of the expedition. Even-tempered, like most big men who have never been forced to fight, Ox had made his recent living in the Hawk Haven military. During the current lull in hostilities, however, he had left the military to serve as Earl Kestrel's bodyguard.<br>Ox's birth name, Derian had learned to his surprise, was Malvin Hogge.<br>"But no one's called me that since long before my hair started receding," he'd told Derian, rubbing ruefully where his curly hairline was making an undignified and premature retreat. "But I prefer the name that my buddies in Kestrel Company gave me long ago and, strangely enough, no one ever calls me 'Malvin' twice."<br>Unlike Derian, Ox felt no inordinate awe toward Race Forester, aware that in his own way he was as valuable as the guide. How many men could shift a battering ram by themselves or do the work of three packers?<br>"Think that wolf wants us for dinner?" Ox asked Race in his deep-voiced, ponderous way.<br>"Hardly," the guide retorted scornfully. "We're too big a group and wolves, savage as they are, are not stupid."<br>"Well," Ox replied, laughing at-his own joke, "you'd better tell the mules that. I don't think they understand."<br>Sir Jared Surcliffe, a lesser member of Earl Kestrel's own family, but prouder of his recently acquired nickname "Doc" than of any trace of noble blood, crossed to claim the general provisions bundle. Like the earl he had black hair and clear, grey eyes, but his height and build lacked the earl's seeming delicacy. There was strength in his long-fingered hands--as Derian had learned when Jared stitched a cut in his forearm a couple of weeks back. Derian recalled that Doc had won honors in battle, so he must have other strengths as well.<br>"Valet has the fire started," Jared said, an upper-class accent giving his simple statement unwonted authority. "I'll start dinner. Race, shouldn't you see if there might be a fish or two in yonder brook? Earl Kestrel would enjoy fresh trout with his dinner."<br>Had anyone but Jared or the earl himself even hinted at giving the guide orders, he might have found himself standing a late-night watch on an anthill. Race Forester, though, for all his pride in his skills, knew when he could--and could not--push his social betters.<br>"Right," he grunted, and departed, whistling for Queenie, his bird dog. The red-spotted hound reluctantly abandoned the station near the fire from which she'd been watching Earl Kestrel's man unpack the delicacies kept for the earl's own consumption.<br>When the wolf howled again, Derian wondered how much of Queenie's reluctance was due to leaving the food and how much to the proximity of the big predator.<br>"They say that the wolves in the mountains are bigger than anything found in settled lands," Derian said, talking to distract himself and feeling freer to speculate now that Race was gone,<br>"They do," Doc agreed, "but I've always wondered, just who has seen these giant wolves? Few people have gone beyond the foothills of the Iron Mountains--those mostly miners and trappers. As far as I know, the only ones to have crossed the range are Prince Harden and those who went with him."<br>Derian finished currying Roanne and moved to the earl's Coal before answering.<br>"Maybe in the early days," he hazarded, "when the colonies were new. Maybe people saw the wolves then."<br>"Possibly," Jared said agreeably, shaping a journey cake on its board. "And possibly it's all grandmother's fire stories. Race <i>is</i> right. Wolves and other night creatures do sound bigger when you're camping."<br>Conversation lagged as the members of the expedition hurried to complete their chores before the last of the late-spring light faded. Part of the reason Earl Kestrel had planned his journey for this time of year was that the days would be growing longer, but after hours spent riding on muddy trails, the evenings seemed brief enough.<br><i>Cool, too</i>, Derian thought, blowing on his fingers as he measured grain for the mules and horses. <i>Winter may be gone, but she's not letting us forget her just yet</i>.<br>Ox, who had finished putting up the tents and was now effortlessly chopping wood, paused, his axe in the air.<br>"If you're cold, Derian, you can help me chop this wood. You know what they say, 'Wood warms you twice: once in the cutting, once in the burning.'"<br>Derian grinned at him. "No thanks. I've enough else to finish. Do you think we'll get snow tonight? The air almost has the scent of it."<br>Ox shrugged, measuring his answer out between the blows of his axe. "The mountains do get snow, even this late in the season, but I hope we're not in for any. A blackberry winter's all we need."<br>Derian frowned thoughtfully. "At home I'd say snow would be a good thing for business. It's easier to move goods by sled and people by sleigh, but out here, on horseback...I could do without the snow."<br>"We won't have snow," announced Race, re-entering the camp from the forest fringe. Three long, shining river trout dangled from one hand. "The smoke's rising straight off the fires. Clear but cold tonight. Derian, you might want to break out your spare blankets."<br>Derian nodded. He'd slept cold one night out of a stubborn desire to show himself as tough as the woodsman and had been stiff and nearly useless the next morning. Earl Kestrel himself had chided him for foolish pride.<br>"Our mission is too important to be trifled with," Kestrel had continued in his mincing way. "Mind that you listen to Race Forester's advice from here on."<br>And Derian had nodded and apologized, but in his heart he wondered. Just how important <i>was</i> this mission? King Tedric had seemed content enough these dozen years not knowing his son's fate. And Prince Barden had shown no desire to contact the king.<br>Earl Kestrel had been the one to decide that knowing what had happened to the disinherited prince was important--Kestrel said for the realm, but Derian suspected that the information was important mostly for how it would affect the earl's private ambitions.<br>* * *<br>The young woman was bathing when a thin, tail-chewed female informed her that the One Male wanted her at the den. The messenger, a yearling who had barely made it through her first winter, cringed and groveled as she delivered her message.<br>"When shall I say you will come before him, Firekeeper?" the she-wolf concluded, using the name most of the wolves called the woman--a name indicating a measure of respect, for even the Royal Wolves feared fire.<br>Firekeeper tossed a fat chub to the Whiner. <i>She</i> certainly wasn't going to have time to eat it, not if she must run all the way to the den. Ah, well! She could catch more fish later.<br>"Tell him," she said, considering, "I will be there as fast as two feet can carry me."<br>"Slow enough," sneered the Whiner, emboldened as she remembered how all but the fattest pups could outrun the two-legged wolf.<br>Firekeeper snatched a stone from the bank and, swifter than even the Whiner's paranoia, threw it at the wolf's snout.<br>"<i>Ai-eee</i>!"<br>"That might have been your skull," the woman reminded her. "Go, bone-chewer. My feet may be slow, but my belly is full with the meat of my own hunting!"<br>A lip-curling snarl before the Whiner vanished into the brush showed that the insult had gone home. Faintly, Firekeeper could hear the retreat of her running paws.<br>Her own departure would be less swift. Bending at the waist, she shook the water from her close-cropped hair, then smoothed the locks down, pressing out more water as she did so.<br>Even before her hair had stopped dripping down her back, Firekeeper had retrieved her most valuable possession from where she had set it on a flat rock near the water. It was a fang made of some hard, bright stone. With it, she could kill almost as neatly as a young wolf, skin her prey, sharpen the ends of sticks, and perform many other useful tasks. The One Male of her youngest memories had given it to her when he knew he was going into his last winter.<br>"These are used by those such as yourself, Little Two-legs," he had said fondly, "since they lack teeth or claws useful for hunting. I remember how they are used and can tutor you some, but you will need to discover much for yourself."<br>She had accepted the Fang and the leather Mouth in which it slept. At first she had hung them from a thong about her neck, but later, when she had learned more about their uses, she had contrived a way to hang them from a belt around her waist. Only when she was bathing, for the Fang hated water, did she take it off.<br>Now she held the tool in her teeth while she reached for the cured hide she had hung in a tree lest those like the Whiner chew it to shreds. Most hides she couldn't care less about but this one, taken from an elk killed for the purpose, was special.<br>Out of the center she had cut a hole for her head, wide enough not to chafe her neck. The rest of the skin hung front and back, protecting her most vulnerable parts. A belt made from strips of hide kept the garment in place and she had trimmed away the parts that interfered with free movement of her arms.<br>Some of the young wolves had laughed when she had contrived her first hide, but she had disregarded their taunts. The wolves had fur to protect themselves from brambles and sticks. She must borrow from the more fortunate or be constantly bleeding from some scrape. An extra skin was welcome, too, against the chill.<br>In the winter, she tied rabbit skins along her legs and arms with the fur next to her flesh. The skins were awkward, often slipping or falling off, but were still far better than frostbite.<br>Later in the year, when the days grew hotter and the hide stifling, Firekeeper would wear only a shorter bit of leather around her waist, relinquishing some protection for comfort.<br>Lastly, Firekeeper hung around her neck a small bag containing the special stones with which she could strike fire. She valued these less than the Fang, but without their power she could not have survived this winter or others before it.<br>Faintly, Firekeeper remembered when she did not live this way, when she wore something softer and more yielding than hides, when winters were warmer. Almost, she thought, those memories were a dream, but it was a dream that seemed strangely close as she ran to where the One Male awaited her.<br>* * *<br>The one male was a big silver-grey wolf with a dark streak running along his spine to the tip of his tail and a broad white ruff. He was the third of that title Firekeeper could remember and had held the post for only two years.

What's the appeal of growing old, of gaining responsibilities and giving up on dreams, of steadily trading possibility for experience?<br> The philosopher Susan Neiman argues that the absence of appealing models of maturity is not an accident: by describing life as a downhill process, we prepare young people to expect-and demand-very little from it. In <i>Why Grow Up?</i> she challenges our culture of permanent adolescence, turning to thinkers including Kant, Rousseau, and Arendt to find a model of maturity that is not a matter of resignation. In growing up, we move from the boundless trust of childhood to the peculiar mixture of disappointment and exhilaration that comes with adolescence. Maturity, however, means finding the courage to live in a world of painful uncertainty without giving in to dogma or despair. A grown-up, Neiman writes, helps to move the world closer to what it should be while never losing sight of what it is.<br><i> Why Grow Up?</i> is a witty and concise argument for the value of maturity as a subversive ideal: a goal rarely achieved entirety, and all the more worth striving for.</p></p><p><b>Susan Neiman</b> is the director of the Einstein Forum. Her previous books, translated into many languages, include <i>Moral Clarity: A Guide for Grown-Up Idealists</i>, <i>Evil in Modern Thought: An Alternative History of Philosophy</i>, <i>The Unity of Reason</i>, and <i>Slow Fire: Jewish Notes from Berlin</i>. She also writes cultural and political commentary for diverse media in the United States, Germany, and Great Britain.

She is the mother of three grown children, and currently lives in Berlin.Praise for Susan Neiman <br>"[Neiman] is not only a fine analyst but an acute stylist too, both scintillating and self-disciplined--a very rare thing in a philosopher." --Jonathan Ree, "The Times Literary Supplement"<br><br>Susan Neiman's "Why Grow Up "is a spirited defence of the aspiration to maturity. As she sagely observes, by clinging impotently to youth, we impoverish youth and maturity alike . . .

The Antarctic is the site of the greatest seasonal event on Earth. In March, the air temperatures drop to as low as -40�F, the ocean, which turns to ice at 28.7�F, starts freezing at the incredible average rate of 2.22 square miles per minute! </p><p> This is the first book to explain in non-technical terms and show with color photography the abundance of life on, in and under the ice. </p><p> Topics include:</p><ul> <li>The nature of pack ice</li> <li>Pack ice regions of the world</li> <li>Life within a block of ice</li> <li>Microbiology inside the ice</li> <li>Mammals, birds and ice.</li> </ul><p></p><p> Scientists are continually being surprised by the abundance of life where no life was expected. For many years, ice was seen as an obstacle to exploration and a threat to life. The ice is now perceived as central to global ocean circulation as well as global climate patterns. <b>Frozen Oceans</b> is a must for anyone with an interest in the polar regions, marine biology and the Earth's environment. </p></p><p><p> <b>David N. Thomas</b> is a marine biologist who has conducted four expeditions to the Antarctic and two to Arctic pack ice. He has written science features for <i>Science</i>, <i>BBC Wildlife Magazine</i> and <i>New Scientist</i>. </p><p><b> Preface </b></p><p> Pack ice is a layer of frozen seawater typically seen floating on the polar oceans, although it is also a feature of seas such as the Baltic, Caspian and White. It varies in thickness from a few centimetres to tens of metres and at its maximum extent covers up to 13% of the Earth's surface. This makes pack ice one of the major habitat types on the planet, similar, in terms of surface area, to deserts and tundra. Ever since the sealers and whalers began to navigate through regions of pack ice at the end of the 19th century, the physical and mechanical properties of sea ice have been a focus of intense research. </p><p> Pack ice, or as it is commonly called sea ice, not only dominates polar regions but it is also central to global ocean circulation as well as global climate patterns. On a smaller scale, the formation, consolidation and subsequent melt of millions of square kilometres of ice have a fundamental impact on every ecosystem in which sea ice forms. A plethora of micro-organisms live within the ice itself, and sea ice is an important ephemeral feature affecting the seasonal dynamics of many plankton species, as well as the mammals and birds that depend on plankton as food. Some of the larger animals affected by pack ice include whales, seals, polar bears, walruses and even Arctic foxes. </p><p> Although the microscopic ice dwellers were discovered over 150 years ago, it is only in the past 25 years that the biology and chemistry of sea ice have become the focus of systematic investigations. In recent years the study of this extreme environment has intensified, fuelled by the biotechnological potential of micro-organisms from cold habitats. Astrobiologists have even explored their potential as proxies for life on an early Earth or extraterrestrial systems such as Mars and the moons of Jupiter. This book is an introduction to the large-scale distribution of pack ice around the world. The physics of ice formation, ocean dynamics and the consequences for the biology that depends on sea ice is discussed. Historical aspects of pack ice exploration are introduced together with a synopsis of many of the modern-day techniques used to study sea ice. </p><p> Places referred to in the text can be found on the maps on pp. 210 and 211. </p><p><b> Author </b></p><p> <b>David Thomas</b> is a reader in marine biogeochemistry and heads the biogeochemistry group in the School of Ocean Sciences at the University of Wales, Bangor. He has worked with sea-ice related issues since 1991 when he made his first research expedition to the pack ice of the Weddell Sea, Antarctica. He has participated in further sea-ice expeditions in the Southern Ocean, Arctic, Baltic Sea and the White Sea, Russia. He was awarded his PhD from the Botany Department, University of Liverpool in 1988. Before taking up his position in Bangor in 1996, he held four research positions in Germany at the Universities of Bremen and Oldenburg, the Alfred Wegener Institute for Marine and Polar Research, Bremerhaven and the Centre for Marine Tropical Ecology, Bremen. </p><p> -- </p><p> <b>EXCERPTED FROM CHAPTER 1:</b> </p><p><b> What is pack ice? </b></p><p> "Now we are in the very midst of what the prophets would have had us dread so much. The ice is pressing and packing round us with a noise like thunder. It is piling itself up into long walls. And heaps high enough to reach a good way up the Fram's rigging; in fact, it is trying its utmost to grind the Fram into powder." </p><p> This frightening description of the awesome power of the ice was written by the Norwegian Fridtjof Nansen on Friday, October 13, 1893, as his robust ship, the Fram, became stuck in the Arctic pack ice. Together with 12 other adventurers, he was at the beginning of an epic three-year voyage to traverse the Arctic Ocean. During the journey they would be exposed to conditions that would test their seamanship and survival skills to the absolute limits. Nansen, arguably the greatest polar explorer, knew that there was nothing he or his crew could do to combat the extreme physical forces that dominate moving fields of pack ice. He recognised that their survival was down to the strength of their ship and having enough provisions to last the long frozen winter months. </p><p> This can be taken as the point at which scientific investigation of pack ice opened up and understanding of its complexity, and its role in the functioning of the global environment, began to develop and useful practical information in navigation, fishing and climate forecasting was made available. Before this the 'civilized' world had mostly looked on pack ice as a nuisance, unpredictable, obstructive, unproductive and a potential destroyer and wrecker. But at the same time in the Arctic but not in the Antarctic, there was a race of people, Eskimos or, more properly, Inuit, who had knowledge and deep understanding of pack ice. They had lived with it, travelled on it and hunted their food from it for thousands of years. Mostly these people with their natural wisdom were ignored until comparatively recently More will be said about them later. </p><p> Even with all the developments in shipbuilding that have produced immensely strong metal-hulled ice-breaking ships crammed full of the latest satellite-based navigation aids, pack ice just a few centimetres thick can hinder modern day seafarers just as much as the early polar explorers in their wooden vessels. The pack-ice regions of the world are hostile, and only inhabited by man at the very fringes of their extent. They are places of extreme low temperatures, darkness for long periods of the year and severe winds. </p><p> My first impression of the Antarctic pack ice was actually one of extreme beauty. The tranquillity I felt was a complete contrast to the buffeting ocean that had been my lot as the research ship travelled 15 days from Cape Town in South Africa towards the Southern Ocean. But a closer inspection of the huge ice floes, up to several metres thick, effortlessly moving on the ocean surface, rafting on top of each other and forming massive ridges of ice blocks twice my height, was a humbling experience that inspired a healthy caution. The pack ice is not a silent place, and when a ship slowly negotiates a passage between ice floes there is a constant creaking and grinding of ice, almost a haunting groaning that emphasises the alien nature of the frozen landscape. </p><p><b> Icebergs are not pack ice </b></p><p> Pack ice is mostly frozen seawater. In simple terms, the surface of the ocean is cooled down and ice crystals form. These crystals rise to the surface and coalesce to form a frozen layer on the surface of the water. This layer can become thicker, break open and refreeze. Slabs of ice can raft on top of each other and deform, as in Nansen's description above. Ice formed from seawater, or sea ice, therefore varies from loose aggregations of ice crystals through to structures that are tens of metres thick. </p><p> However, when most people think of the polar oceans and seas they picture huge floating icebergs that have broken off from coastal glaciers or ice shelves. There is no doubt that icebergs are a distinctive feature of many pack-ice regions, but they are produced from outside of the pack ice, and are only a small part of a much larger frozen seawater system. Icebergs are not made in the sea, but are large chunks of freshwater ice that have been built up over thousands of years by the gradual freezing of snow and ice on glaciers covering land. </p><p> Nevertheless, one of the most striking sights for anyone who ventures into polar waters is the wonderful array of iceberg shapes. Wind and wave action combine to create bizarre forms, from cathedral-like spires and pinnacles, to caverns and other improbable structures. Icebergs also come in a spectacular range of colours, from the familiar blues and whites through to dark green and even black. </p><p><b> Ice shelves and glaciers </b></p><p> Many of the 'ice stories' that hit the news headlines are in fact talking about icebergs and the breaking up of ice shelves (the thick plates of ice, fed by glaciers, th</p></p><h2>Winning Chess Tactics</h2><p>Newly formatted and updated!&nbsp; Fourteen chapters illustrate the explanations and thinking behind every tactical concept.&nbsp; Learn to use pins, single and double forks, double attacks, skewers, discovered and double checks, multiple threats and other crushing tactics to gain an immediate edge.&nbsp; Each concept is fully explained in easy-to-understand language with diagrams, examples, and game situations so you understand the thinking and game plan behind every move.&nbsp; Tons of diagrams and examples along with insightful comments on strategy and tactics applicable to every player make this a valuable guide for beginning and intermediate players.&nbsp; Includes a beginner's guide to chess notation.&nbsp; 304 pages</p><p></p><h2>A Place in Space: Ethics, Aesthetics, and Watersheds</h2><p>In this classic collection of 29 pieces that span half a century, Gary Snyder explores humans&#x2019; complex, ever-evolving attitudes toward the environment. He argues that nature is not separate from humanity, but intrinsic to it, and that since societies are natural constructs, it&#x2019;s imperative to go beyond racial, ethnic, and religious identities to find a shared concern for acts that benefit humans and nonhumans alike. Included in the collection is his 1971 environmental manifesto Four Changes,&#x201d; which, as he writes in a postscript, is unfortunately truer than ever. In this new edition, Snyder sends out a call-to-action that challenges all beings to take moral responsibility, a call that resounds with readers discovering the book for the first time or those returning to an old favorite.</p><p>This richly rewarding book about ecology and technology draws on 40 years of careful thought. Although it does not dwell on information technologies, the points Snyder makes about &#34;a feeling of place&#34; are of interest to anyone who has mulled over the ways in which cyberspace jogs our normative notions of time, space, and community.Gary Snyder has been a professor of English on the faculty of the University of California at Davis since 1985.</p><h2>History Of Indian Tribes Of North America - 3 Volume Set: McKenney and Hall</h2><p><p>One of the finest artistic and anthropological records of the Native Americans ever published.

Widely regarded as one of the New Deal's most important art projects, the Index began in 1935 as a unit of the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project. Its aim was to compile and eventually publish a visual archive of American folk, popular, and decorative art from the time of settlement to about 1900. The approximately 1,000 artists involved in the project created more than 18,000 meticulous watercolor portraits of Americana. <br><br>The book presents 82 of the finest watercolor renderings along with a selection of the artifacts they represent. The original objects range from quilts, weather vanes, and hand-carved toys to carousel animals, stoneware, and cigar-store figures. Three essays explore the history, operation, and ambitions of the Index of American Design, examine folk-art collecting in America during the early decades of the twentieth century, and consider the Index's role in the search for a national cultural identity in the early twentieth-century United States. <br><br><i>Drawing on America's Past</i> is the companion publication to an exhibition that runs at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., from 27 November 2002 through 2 March 2003.<br><br></p><p>"Includes 82 outstanding examples in color plates, which present a watercolor illustration adjacent to the original object.

Its institutions have fed the hungry, sheltered the homeless, and advocated for the poor. Christian faith has sustained people through crisis and inspired many to work for social justice.</p><p>Yet although the word "Christian" connotes the epitome of goodness, the actual story is much more complex. Over the last two millennia, ruling elites have used Christian institutions and values to control those less privileged throughout the world. The doctrine of Christianity has been interpreted to justify the killing of millions, and its leaders have used their faith to sanction participation in colonialism, slavery, and genocide. In the Western world, Christian influence has inspired legislators to continue to limit women's reproductive rights and has kept lesbians and gays on the margins of society.</p><p>As our triple crises of war, financial meltdown, and environmental destruction intensify, it is imperative that we dig beneath the surface of Christianity's benign reputation to examine its contribution to our social problems. <i>Living in the Shadow of the Cross</i> reveals the ongoing, everyday impact of Christian power and privilege on our beliefs, behaviors, and public policy, and emphasizes the potential for people to come together to resist domination and build and sustain communities of justice and peace.</p><p><b>Paul Kivel</b> is the award-winning author of <i>Uprooting Racism</i> and the director of the Christian Hegemony Project.

The survivors who remain are scared, bewildered, and in need of a leader. Two emerge--Mother Abagail, the benevolent 108-year-old woman who urges them to build a community in Boulder, Colorado; and Randall Flagg, the nefarious "Dark Man," who delights in chaos and violence.</p></p><p>In 1978, science fiction writer Spider Robinson wrote a scathing review of <i>The Stand</i> in which he exhorted his readers to grab strangers in bookstores and beg them not to buy it.<p> <i>The Stand</i> is like that. You either love it or hate it, but you can't ignore it. Stephen King's most popular book, according to polls of his fans, is an end-of-the-world scenario: a rapidly mutating flu virus is accidentally released from a U.S. military facility and wipes out 99 and 44/100 percent of the world's population, thus setting the stage for an apocalyptic confrontation between Good and Evil.</p><p> "I <i>love</i> to burn things up," King says. "It's the werewolf in me, I guess.... <i>The Stand</i> was particularly fulfilling, because there I got a chance to scrub the whole human race, and man, it was fun! ... Much of the compulsive, driven feeling I had while I worked on <i>The Stand</i> came from the vicarious thrill of imagining an entire entrenched social order destroyed in one stroke."</p><p> There is much to admire in <i>The Stand</i>: the vivid thumbnail sketches with which King populates a whole landscape with dozens of believable characters; the deep sense of nostalgia for things left behind; the way it subverts our sense of reality by showing us a world we find familiar, then flipping it over to reveal the darkness underneath. Anyone who wants to know, or claims to know, the heart of the American experience needs to read this book. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.<br><br>And here is the bleak new world of the day after: a world stripped of its institutions and emptied of 99 percent of its people. A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides -- or are chosen. A world in which good rides on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abigail -- and the worst nightmares of evil are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the dark man.<br><br>In 1978 Stephen King published <i>The Stand</i>, the novel that is now considered to be one of his finest works. But as it was first published, <i>The Stand</i> was incomplete, since more than 150,000 words had been cut from the original manuscript.<br><br>Now Stephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil has been restored to its entirety. <i>The Stand</i> : <i>The Complete And Uncut Edition</i> includes more than five hundred pages of material previously deleted, along with new material that King added as he reworked the manuscript for a new generation. It gives us new characters and endows familiar ones with new depths. It has a new beginning and a new ending. What emerges is a gripping work with the scope and moral comlexity of a true epic.<br><br>For hundreds of thousands of fans who read <i>The Stand</i> in its original version and wanted more, this new edition is Stephen King's gift. And those who are reading <i>The Stand</i> for the first time will discover a triumphant and eerily plausible work of the imagination that takes on the issues that will determine our survival.</p><h2>The Gift of Rest: Rediscovering the Beauty of the Sabbath</h2><p>The Sabbath is a gift that Senator Joe Lieberman, as an observant Jew, received from his parents who, in turn, received it from their parents, who received it from generations of Jews before them. According to ancient tradition, the line of transmission extends back to Moses at Mt. Sinai, who received the Sabbath as the fourth of the Ten Commandments. In this book,&nbsp;Lieberman will offer the gift of Sabbath observance&#x2014;a gift that has anchored, ordered, and inspired his life&#x2014;to readers of all faiths.&nbsp;<br><br>In the past century, the Sabbath has fallen on hard times. It is thought of as just another day or as a time to squeeze in some extra errands or recreation that you may have missed during the workweek. The weekend passes in a blur of often meaningless activity. Combining personal and political memoir with history and broadly informed religious reflection, this book is a practical how-to guide, with simple suggestions for introducing the Sabbath into your own life.&nbsp;It will be a very personal book, yet also one animated by reflections on history and larger social trends. It will also&nbsp;include profound reflections of both classical and modern Jewish sages, from the Talmud and the ancient Jewish prayer book, the Siddur, to Maimonides, to Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel and Rabbi Soloveitchik.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Joe Lieberman</b> is a United States senator representing Connecticut.

But I don&#x2019;t always make it as early as I hoped. Sometimes when I walk into the kitchen, my wife, Hadassah, will be on the phone with one of our kids. &#x201c;Oh, Daddy just walked through the door,&#x201d; she says with a wry glance in my direction. &#x201c;He said he&#x2019;d be home at two-thirty. Oh, look, its four already!&#x201d;<br> <br>In accordance with Jewish tradition, I always bring flowers home for Hadassah and our Shabbat table on Fridays. A Capitol Hill newspaper once surveyed members of Congress, asking, among other things, &#x201c;Do you ever buy your wife flowers?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;How often?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Every week,&#x201d; I answered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh my goodness,&#x201d; said the reporter, &#x201c;you are so romantic!&#x201d; The resulting article nominated me as one of the most romantic members of Congress.<br> <br>I like to think of myself as romantic, but flowers on Friday afternoon is as much a gesture of respect and love for Shabbat as it is one of respect and love for my wife. The beauty and smell of the flowers&#x2014;even the ritual of stopping at the Safe-way in Georgetown or the Stop &amp; Shop in Stamford to pick them up&#x2014;is part of my preparation for the Sabbath.<br> <br>Of course Hadassah is well ahead of me in getting ready. The forbidden labors of the Sabbath&#x2014;thirty-nine categories, all detailed by the rabbinical authorities of long ago&#x2014;are creative activities that imitate God&#x2019;s creativity in the first six days. They include lighting a fire, and by extension, lighting an electric light or using a combustion engine like the one that makes your car move. Handling money is forbidden on Shabbat, and we don&#x2019;t go shopping or engage in business. Cooking is prohibited, so Hadassah prepares the Sabbath meals on Thursday night and/or Friday.<br> <br>The Sabbath does not just happen spontaneously at sundown on Friday. In some important ways, it begins as darkness falls on the preceding Saturday night and we prepare to return to the six days of work. We leave Shabbat, knowing it is our responsibility to be as creative and purposeful for the next six days as God was in creating the Heaven and Earth. But we also yearn to return to Shabbat to enjoy the gift of rest, just as God enjoyed the seventh day as the culmination of His creation.<br> <br>By Thursday night Hadassah has decided on a plan of action for our meals. By Friday afternoon all is ready, and the wonderful smells of food fill the house. The dining room table is set with our best china, embellished by the flowers I have brought.<br> <br> <b> <b> MEMORIES OF SHABBAT </b> </b> <br> <br>My earliest memories of Shabbat are in my grandmother&#x2019;s house&#x2014;where we lived until I was eight years old. On Friday morning and afternoon, the house was busy with activity and cooking and cleaning, as if we were preparing for the arrival of a very honored guest.<br> <br>In 1950, Mom and Dad, along with my sisters Rietta and Ellen and I, moved into our own house on Strawberry Hill Court in Stamford, about two miles north of my grand-mother&#x2019;s. The warm, rich Sabbath memories continued there. Of all the blessings I have received in my life, the first was one of the best&#x2014;maybe the best ever. I was blessed to be born the son of wonderful parents, Henry and Marcia Lieberman. They were loving, supportive, and principled. They taught my sisters and me a lot, and gave us a lot, including the gift of Sabbath rest and observance.<br> <br>Mom and Dad came from very different religious backgrounds, but together they created a unified, religious home. My mother&#x2019;s family was very observant. My dad&#x2019;s was not. My father&#x2019;s mother, Rebecca, died in New York in the influenza epidemic in 1918 when he was only three, and his father, Jacob, put him into an orphanage for Jewish boys where he stayed until he was ten. When his father remarried and moved to New Haven, he brought my father and his sister, Hannah, to live there with his new wife and her children. Dad&#x2019;s family was very secular, so he received no religious education and didn&#x2019;t even have a Bar Mitzvah. He graduated from high school in 1933 in the Depression, but though he was intellectually brilliant, he could not go to college. Instead he took a series of jobs that began on an overnight delivery truck for a bakery in Bridgeport and culminated in a factory in Stamford, where at a Purim dance (celebrating the story of Queen Esther) at the Stamford Jewish Center, he met Mom. When they got engaged, two members of her family who owned liquor stores offered to help Dad lease and open his own liquor store. They all agreed that as soon as he was making twenty-five dollars a week, they could get married. That incentive system worked well, and they married in 1940. It was only before their wedding&#x2014;at the insistence of my mother&#x2019;s family&#x2014;that Dad took lessons and had his Bar Mitzvah. Although he came to Judaism later in life, his faith was deep and informed. He studied religious texts and commentaries, often in his liquor store between customers, and became quite learned. Later he joined a class in modern conversational Hebrew and became fluent. He loved the Sabbath, but as was the custom for many men at the time, he kept his liquor store open on Friday night and Saturdays because he could not afford to close. For most of my childhood, Dad would try to come home early for dinner on Friday and break for lunch on Saturday, but was otherwise not at home or synagogue on the Sabbath.<br> <br>Dad was a deductive believer in God, founding his faith in God&#x2019;s existence on the extraordinary sophistication and order of the natural world and on the miraculous continuity and survival of the Jewish people in the human world. Neither, he concluded, could have happened without divine support.<br> <br>Dad created the intellectual basis for my religious observance, and Mom provided the spiritual depth and traditional ritual-blessed home environment to which my faith attached itself and grew. Together, they built a very spiritual home, with great pleasures and high expectations for my sisters and me. The Friday pre-Shabbat experiences that I first had in my grandmother&#x2019;s house continued and grew in Mom and Dad&#x2019;s house.<br> <br>I would come home from school on Friday afternoon and immediately inhale the aroma of the chicken soup, meat, or <i>kugel</i>&#x2014;a sweet baked noodle dish&#x2014;or whatever else was cooking. I would go over to the stove and pick up the lid of the chicken soup pot, smell it, and then take a spoonful. Years later, when Hadassah first saw me tasting from the soup pot on Friday afternoon in my mother&#x2019;s kitchen, she was appalled.<br> <br>&#x201c;How can you do that!&#x201d; she asked in her most mannerly New England tone.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my tradition,&#x201d; I answered, with a big smile as if I was Tevye in <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>. But Hadassah was unconvinced.<br> <br>Later I learned I had the Code of Jewish Law on my side. It may surprise you that Judaism has such things codified, but one highly authoritative legal commentary, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>, actually says, &#x201c;It is meritorious to taste every dish on Erev Shabbos, so as to see that it is prepared well and properly.&#x201d; Little did I realize that I had such esteemed authority to justify my undisciplined Friday afternoon ardor for chicken soup.<br> <br>The Midrash, a compilation of ancient rabbinic traditions, tells the story of a Roman Emperor, named Antoninus Pius, who had a close friendship with Rabbi Judah HaNasi (the prince), the head of the Jewish community in the land of Israel at the end of the second century. Rabbi Judah served him a delicious meal when the emperor visited him on Shabbat. On another occasion, Antoninus visited on a weekday. Although the food was as elaborately prepared as before, it did not taste nearly as good. When the emperor mentioned this, Rabbi Judah replied that unfortunately each dish was missing a very special ingredient. The emperor then asked: Why did you leave out the ingredient this time? Were you skimping on costs? Rabbi Judah replied: The missing spice is the Shabbat. Food prepared and eaten in the ambience of the Sabbath has a special, delicious flavor which we cannot duplicate at a weekday meal (<i>Genesis Rabba 11:4</i>).<br> <br>In the opening scene in Marcel Proust&#x2019;s <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, the narrator tastes a cookie, a madeleine, that he associates with his childhood and that spontaneously fills him with memories and sensations. When it comes to the Sabbath, we taste or smell or see or hear, and immediately we are transported to Shabbatland&#x2014;as Hadassah and I call it&#x2014;with all its religious, mystical, and sensual meanings and memories. So when I walk into Hadassah&#x2019;s kitchen today and smell the baking <i>challah</i>, the specially braided bread of Shabbat, I am instantly transported to the kitchen of another woman whose influence on me was so crucial that, without it, I might not be a Sabbath observer today.<br> <br>My maternal grandmother, Minnie, or &#x201c;Maintza&#x201d; as she was known in Yiddish, was the religious foundation of our home. I associate her with many things, of course, but preparing for Shabbat is high on that list. We spent the first eight years of my childhood living on the second floor of her house. We called her Baba, a Yiddish word for &#x201c;Grandma.&#x201d; After we moved into a home of our own, Baba would spend most Sabbaths with us. She would appear at our door on Friday afternoon, Erev Shabbat, with a towel full of pastries or a pot full of some other food she had made for us. I can almost smell the pastries&#x2014;the sweet, crescent-shaped <i>rugelach</i>&#x2014;and the wonderful firm, little sugar cookies. She often brought us <i>challah</i>, along with delicious chicken soup.<br> <br>Baba was one of the most patriotic Americans I have ever known. Like countless other immigrants to this country, she had something to compare America to&#x2014;the place from which she came. There, she and her family were poor and religiously harassed. Here, she found opportunity and acceptance. One of the most miraculous experiences of her life, she once told me, was when her Christian neighbors in our ethnically diverse neighborhood would see her walking to synagogue on Saturday morning and say, &#x201c;Good Sabbath, Mrs. Manger.&#x201d; At those moments, Baba probably thought she was not in Connecticut, but in heaven.<br> <br>Years later in 2000, on the first Sabbath after I accepted the Democratic nomination for vice president, Hadassah and I and some of our kids ended up in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. As we walked through the lovely streets from our hotel to the local synagogue on Saturday morning, people came out of their homes to wish us a good Sabbath. I thought of Baba and how right she was to be a grateful and patriotic American.<br> <br>By the time of her passing away in 1967, at age eighty-six, she had moved into our house full-time. The very last words Baba spoke on the day of her death were about honoring Shabbat by preparing for it. I was in law school at Yale and clearly remember being called that Friday afternoon and told that Baba had suffered a serious stroke and that I should rush back to Stamford. On the last Erev Shabbat of Baba&#x2019;s life, my mother later told me, she and Baba were in the kitchen. Baba, sitting idly at the table, said to my mother, &#x201c;Masha, give me something to do <i>l&#x2019;kavod Shabbos,</i>&#x201d; which means to honor the Sabbath. My mother gave her some carrots and onions to chop for the soup. She was chopping vegetables <i>l&#x2019;kavod Shabbos</i> when she fell ill for the last time. She died that Friday night, on Shabbos, which tradition says is a special blessing for the righteous.<br> <br>At that time in my own life, I had fallen away from Sabbath observance. During my first semester as an undergraduate at Yale, I was sincerely worried that I would flunk out. I hadn&#x2019;t yet realized that to get kicked out of Yale for poor grades actually required quite a determined effort. I could have easily taken time off from my school work on Shabbat, but anxiety about my academic performance, combined with peer social pressures not to be different, pulled me away in surprisingly short order, and I stopped observing the Sabbath. Ironically, I still put on <i>tefillin</i>, the little black leather boxes filled with sacred scrolls that observant Jewish men wear on their arms and head for morning prayer, and said my prayers each morning. Why did I do one and not the other? Maybe, I must admit, it was because putting on <i>tefillin</i> was private and personal, and Shabbat was more public and interrupted the weekend social flow of college life.<br> <br>During college, I continued to observe the Jewish dietary laws, but by the time I reached law school, I also began straying in my eating. When I look back at this time, I am amused and a bit embarrassed by the strange distinctions I made. I would eat non-kosher chicken or beef, but never with milk because the mixing of meat and milk products is an additional prohibition in the Torah. I continued to refrain from ham, bacon, or shellfish, except on one memorable occasion. Someone convinced me to try Lobster Newburgh. After all, I reasoned, the lobster was removed from its familiar shell and cloaked in a rich sauce, therefore making it unrecognizable to both me and God. I took one mouthful of the shellfish, chewed it, swallowed it, and immediately proceeded to the men&#x2019;s room where I puked up everything in my stomach. I suspect my stomach upset had more to do with theology and psychology than with gastronomy or gastroenterology.<br> <br>My Baba&#x2019;s death in 1967 marked the beginning of my return to Jewish observance. There was a synagogue right across the street from where I had lived for more than a year in New Haven, Connecticut but I had never gone there. The Shabbat after Baba passed away, I remember saying, &#x201c;I really want to go to <i>shul&#x201d;&#x2014;shul</i> is the Yiddish term for synagogue.<br> <br>Was it because of my grandmother&#x2019;s last words, which so hauntingly conveyed her love of preparing for the arrival of Shabbat? Perhaps indirectly. But uppermost in my mind was the worry that Baba was my link with the Judaism of my ancestors, the Judaism of history. If I let go of the link in the chain, it would be broken and lost to me and my children after me. And so I slowly began my return to regular synagogue attendance and Sabbath and religious observance.<br> <br>When I think of Erev Shabbat, I think also of Baba&#x2019;s husband, my grandfather. His name was Joseph Manger. I am named for him and therefore never knew him because we Jews of European ancestry name for deceased relatives or friends. He died when my mother was just a child and he was only forty-two; his death, too, was strangely linked to Sabbath observance.<br> <br>My grandfather started in the soda business in Stamford, and like many Jewish immigrants at that time he decided that supporting his family ruled out giving up that day of work on Saturday. He had been a very religiously observant man in Europe, and in 1922, he finally reached a time in America when he felt he could afford to stop working on Shabbat. It happened that year that the two-day Jewish festival of Shavuot&#x2014;which like the Christian Pentecost, occurs fifty days after the beginning of Passover&#x2014;began on Sunday...</p><h2>Fundamentals of Corporate Finance, ninth edition</h2><p>Printed in Asia - Carries Same Contents as of US edition - Opt Expedited Shipping for 3 to 4 day delivery -</p><p></p><h2>Legend of Pradeep Mathew</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the Commonwealth Book Prize</b></p><p><i>* Winner of the $50,000 DSC Prize for South Asian Literature *</i><br><i>* A </i>Publishers Weekly <i>"First Fiction" Pick for Spring 2012 *</i></p><p>"A crazy ambidextrous delight.

Thankfully, we are guided through the novel by charming, aging, alcoholic sportswriter-bounder W. G. (Wije) Karunasena and his trusted friend Ari Byrd&#x2014;both equally passionate and opinionated about cricket&#x2014;as they seek out the elusive (and fictional) Tamil bowler Pradeep Mathew, whose patchy but brilliant career included Sri Lanka&#x2019;s inspired (and real-life) World Cup championship in 1996. Arguing and deconstructing cricket all the way, the pair leads us to, among other places, Colombo&#x2019;s living rooms, bars, casinos, and cricket pitches&#x2014;and their attendant characters&#x2014;all played out amid the island&#x2019;s heartrending, surreal, 26-year-long civil war. If Ondaatje&#x2019;s Anil&#x2019;s Ghost (2000) portrayed that war in darkly rendered overtones, Karunatilaka weaves it into the whole cloth of Colombo&#x2019;s comically absurd daily life. Yet droll as his observations might be (&#x201c;They say ambulances in Sri Lanka barely make it to the funeral&#x201d;), Wije is clear-eyed about his own and his country&#x2019;s failings and the terrors those failings have produced. More impressive, Wije, like many of his countrymen, carries a heroism he hardly knows he has. --Alan Moores</p><h2>The Antidote</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>Steel Drivin&#39; Man: John Henry: the Untold Story of an American Legend</h2><p>The ballad "John Henry" is the most recorded folk song in American history and John Henry--the mighty railroad man who could blast through rock faster than a steam drill--is a towering figure in our culture. But for over a century, no one knew who the original John Henry was--or even if there was a real John Henry.<br> In <em>Steel Drivin' Man</em>, Scott Reynolds Nelson recounts the true story of the man behind the iconic American hero, telling the poignant tale of a young Virginia convict who died working on one of the most dangerous enterprises of the time, the first rail route through the Appalachian Mountains. Using census data, penitentiary reports, and railroad company reports, Nelson reveals how John Henry, victimized by Virginia's notorious Black Codes, was shipped to the infamous Richmond Penitentiary to become prisoner number 497, and was forced to labor on the mile-long Lewis Tunnel for the C&amp;O railroad. Nelson even confirms the legendary contest between John Henry and the steam drill (there was indeed a steam drill used to dig the Lewis Tunnel and the convicts in fact drilled faster). <br> Equally important, Nelson masterfully captures the life of the ballad of John Henry, tracing the song's evolution from the first printed score by blues legend W. C. Handy, to Carl Sandburg's use of the ballad to become the first "folk singer," to the upbeat version by Tennessee Ernie Ford. We see how the American Communist Party appropriated the image of John Henry as the idealized American worker, and even how John Henry became the precursor of such comic book super heroes as Superman or Captain America.<br> Attractively illustrated with numerous images, <em>Steel Drivin' Man</em> offers a marvelous portrait of a beloved folk song--and a true American legend.</p><p><br><strong>Scott Reynolds Nelson</strong> is Associate Professor of History at the College of William and Mary. The author of <em>Iron Confederacies: Southern Railways, Klan Violence, and Reconstruction</em>, he has served as a consultant on the forthcoming PBS documentary on John Henry.<br><br>"In this compelling and consistently engaging narrative, Nelson reveals as much about the cultural politics of the twentieth century as he does about race, railroads, and Reconstruction in the nineteenth."--John C.

It's like John Henry: It's short, and it does its job well."--<em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution </em><p></p><br>"Fascinating...Nelson is an able storyteller, and the finding of John Henry opens up any number of tales to the telling.... John Henry's story is also the story of the robber barons who built railroads (and, in John Henry's case, railroad tunnels) with slave labor and at public expense; it is the story of racial hatreds; it is the story of emerging technologies; and it is the story of how one particular song came to be used, and reused."--<em>No Depression</em> Magazine<p></p><br>"In his remarkable book, <em>Steel Drivin' Man,</em> Nelson delves into American folklore to produce an original, compelling, sometimes speculative but always fascinating biography of the mythic figure...skillfully pieces together enough historical fragments to establish the credibility of Henry's existence. Nelson compensates for the paucity of detailed biographical information by providing a succinct, first-rate account of Reconstruction in post-Civil War Virginia, the growth of the Southern railway industry, the operation of the brutal convict-labor system and the migration of Southern blacks to the urban North...Nelson's accomplishment lies in eloquently breathing life into an iconic figure and elegantly re-creating his lost world in a mode that is respectful, moving and entertaining."--<em>Chicago Tribune</em><p></p><br>"Written at the crossroads where American myth and reality intersect, <em>Steel Drivin' Man: John Henry, The Untold Story of an American Legend</em> is a tribute and requiem to the real steel drivin' men who built this country."--Bruce Springsteen<p></p><br>"Traces the history of the folk ballad of John Henry, and discusses the true story behind the song, of a black Virginia convict who died building the railroad through the Appalachians."--<em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em><p></p><br>"His deft detective work, in effect, serves as a search warrant, authorizing him, as he traces the evolution of the song, to drill deep down into the scorched earth of the South in the years after the Civil War to lay bare the lives of African Americans under the notorious Black Codes."--<em>The</em> <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em><p></p><br>"Over the last century, the legend of macho steelworker John Henry with his ''two twenty pound hammers'' has been appropriated by chain gangs, Communist radicals, and Johnny Cash. The real Henry, usually envisioned as a bulky strongman, was in fact a 5' 1'' convict from Elizabeth, N.J., as Scott Reynolds Nelson shows in his slim, meticulously researched [book]. He sifts through prison records, railroad progress reports, and census data--as well as songs and art--to create a multilayered portrait of a poor teen, his tragic run-ins with racist Black Codes laws (and his likely wrongful conviction), and his unexpected journey to iconhood."--Michelle Kung, <em>Entertainment Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Readers will find his imaginative reconstruction of the John Henry story a profound and welcome acknowledgement of the unrecognized labors that went into building this country..."--<em>The Houston Chronicle</em><p></p><br>"What Mr. Nelson proves is the undying power of the John Henry myth, which reduces almost to a pinpoint the historical figure he resurrects from the archives. Whether or not John William Henry is the man seems almost irrelevant. He is a fascinating guide to the world of Southern railroads and the grim landscape of Reconstruction."--William Grimes, <em>The New York Times</em><p></p><br>"A remarkable work of scholarship and a riveting story.... This slender book is many-layered. It's Nelson's story of piecing together the biography of the real John Henry, and rarely is the tale of hours logged in archives so interesting. It's the story of fatal racism in the postbellum South. And it's the story of work songs, songs that not only turned Henry into a folk hero but, in reminding workers to slow down or die, were a tool of resistance and protest."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"The discovery of new documentation combined with Scott Reynolds Nelson's rapid and engaging tour through a broad landscape of American history and culture allows us more fully to grasp the political, racial, and technological context in which John Henry lived and his legend grew."--Gavin James Campbell, <em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Husband Hunters</h2><p>Towards the end of the nineteenth century and for the first few years of the twentieth, a strange invasion took place in Britain. The citadel of power, privilege and breeding in which the titled, land-owning governing class had barricaded itself for so long was breached. The incomers were a group of young women who, fifty years earlier, would have been looked on as the alien denizens of another world - the New World, to be precise. From 1874 - the year that Jennie Jerome, the first known &#39;Dollar Princess&#39;, married Randolph Churchill - to 1905, dozens of young American heiresses married into the British peerage, bringing with them all the fabulous wealth, glamour and sophistication of the Gilded Age. Anne de Courcy sets the stories of these young women and their families in the context of their times. Based on extensive first-hand research, drawing on diaries, memoirs and letters, this richly entertaining group biography reveals what they thought of their new lives in England - and what England thought of them.</p><p>Anne de Courcy is the author of thirteen widely acclaimed works of social history and biography, including MARGOT AT WAR, THE FISHING FLEET, THE VICEROY&#39;S DAUGHTERS and DEBS AT WAR.

Mortality is not kind, and do not let anyone tell you it is. If there is such a thing as wisdom, and I have serious doubts about its presence in my own life, it lies in the acceptance of the human condition and perhaps the knowledge that those who have passed on are still with us, out there in the mist, showing us the way, sometimes uttering a word of caution from the shadows, sometimes visiting us in our sleep, as bright as a candle burning inside a basement that has no windows.<br> <br>On a winter morning, among white clouds of fog out at Spanish Lake, I would see the boys in butternut splashing their way through the flooded cypress, their muskets held above their heads, their equipment tied with rags so it wouldn&#x2019;t rattle. I was standing no more than ten feet from them, although they took no notice of me, as though they knew I had not been born yet, and their travail and sacrifice were not mine to bear.<br> <br>Their faces were lean from privation, as pale as wax, their hair uncut, the rents in their uniforms stitched clumsily with string. Their mouths were pinched, their eyes luminous with caution. The youngest soldier, a drummer boy, could not have been older than twelve. On one occasion I stepped into the water to join them. Even then, none acknowledged my presence. The drummer boy stumbled and couldn&#x2019;t right himself, struggling with the leather strap around his neck and the weight of his drum. I reached out to help him and felt my hand and arm sink through his shoulder. A shaft of sunlight pierced the canopy, turning the fog into white silk; in less than a second the column was gone.<br> <br>Long ago, I ceased trying to explain events such as these to either myself or others. Like many my age, I believe people in groups are to be feared and that arguing with others is folly and the knowledge of one generation cannot be passed down to the next. Those may seem cynical sentiments, but there are certain truths you keep inside you and do not defend lest you cheapen and then lose them altogether. Those truths have less to do with the dead than the awareness that we are no different from them, that they are still with us and we are still with them, and there is no afterlife but only one life, a continuum in which all time occurs at once, like a dream inside the mind of God.<br> <br>Why should an old man thrice widowed dwell on things that are not demonstrable and have nothing to do with a reasonable view of the world? Because only yesterday, on a broken sidewalk in a shabby neighborhood at the bottom of St. Claude Avenue, in the Lower Ninth Ward of St. Bernard Parish, under a colonnade that was still twisted out of shape by Katrina, across from a liquor store with barred windows that stood under a live oak probably two hundred years old, I saw a platoon of Confederate infantry march out of a field to the tune of &#x201c;Darling Nelly Gray&#x201d; and disappear through the wall of a gutted building and not exit on the other side.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>THE MAN I came to see was Fat Tony Nemo, also known as Tony the Nose, Tony Squid, or Tony Nine Ball, the latter not because he was a pool shark but because he packed a nine ball into a bartender&#x2019;s mouth with the butt of a pool cue. Of course, that was during his earlier incarnation, when he was a collector for Didoni Giacano and the two of them used to drive around New Orleans in Didi&#x2019;s Caddy convertible, terrifying whoever couldn&#x2019;t make the weekly vig, a bloodstained baseball bat propped up in the backseat. Currently, Fat Tony was involved in politics and narcotics and porn and casinos and Hollywood movies and the concrete business. He had also laundered money for the Triads in Hong Kong and helped Somoza&#x2019;s greaseballs introduce crack cocaine to America&#x2019;s inner cities. In terms of territory, he had fingers in pies all over Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida. If he had any sense of morality or fear about a judgment down the track, I never saw it.<br> <br>So why would a semi-retired sheriff&#x2019;s detective from Iberia Parish want to make a social call on a psychopath like Tony Squid? Simple. Most investigative cops, often without knowing who Niccol� Machiavelli was, adhere to his admonition to keep your friends close but your enemies closer. Less simple is the fact that we share much of the same culture as the lowlifes, and we are more alike than different, and the information they give us is indispensable.<br> <br>Fat Tony was sitting in a swivel chair behind his desk when I entered his office. No, that&#x2019;s not correct. Tony didn&#x2019;t sit; he piled himself into a chair or on a couch like a gelatinous heap of whale sperm thrown on a beach, except he was wearing a blue suit with a red boutonniere in the lapel. A sword with a scrolled brass guard in a plain metal scabbard lay across his ink pad. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you could come, Dave. You never disappoint.

What kind of question is that?&#x201d; He had to catch his breath before he could continue. &#x201c;Want a drink?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, thanks.

Take Clete Purcel to a meeting with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s Clete done?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What hasn&#x2019;t he done? He&#x2019;s a fucking cancer on the whole city. He should have a steel codpiece locked on his body so he can&#x2019;t reproduce.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How can I help you, Tony?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe I can help you. I heard about your wife.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I appreciate your concern. I need to get back to New Iberia.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She got killed in an accident?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;What, about three months ago?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two years. She was T-boned by a guy in a pickup. I&#x2019;d rather talk about something else.&#x201d;<br> <br>He handed me the sword. &#x201c;I got this at a flea market in Memphis. I asked an expert what it&#x2019;s worth. He said he&#x2019;d take if off my hands for three thousand. The real value, what is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know about history, what the names of these places on the hilt mean, whether those places make the sword more valuable. What&#x2019;s this Cemetery Hill stuff? Who fights a war in a fucking cemetery?&#x201d;<br> <br>The brass on the handle was engraved with the name of Lieutenant Robert S. Broussard, Eighth Louisiana Infantry. The base of the blade was stamped with the initials CSA and the name of the maker, James Conning, of Mobile, Alabama, and the year 1861.<br> <br>&#x201c;I did some Googling,&#x201d; Tony said. &#x201c;The guy who owned this was from New Iberia. It&#x2019;s worth a lot more than two or three thousand dollars, right? Maybe the guy was famous for something.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t find any of that on the Internet, with all the Civil War junk that&#x2019;s on sale?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t trust the Internet. It&#x2019;s full of crazoids.&#x201d;<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t begin to sort through the contradictions in what he had just said. This was a typical Fat Tony conversation. Trying to get inside his mind was akin to submerging your hand in an unflushed toilet. Outside, some black kids were breaking bottles with an air rifle in a vacant lot. There were concrete foundations in the lot without structures on them. A garbage truck was driving down a street, seagulls picking at its overflow.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this about Clete?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I got no problem with Purcel. Other people do. It&#x2019;s true he took out that fat dick of his at the Southern Yacht Club and hosed down Bobby Earl&#x2019;s car?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I lied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Two weeks ago he did it again. At the casino.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Clete did?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, the pope. Earl put his lady friend in the car, and suddenly, she&#x2019;s sitting in a puddle of piss.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you show me this sword, Tony?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because the family of the guy who owned it lives in New Iberia. I thought maybe they&#x2019;d want it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does any of this have to do with Clete and Bobby Earl?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>My head was throbbing. &#x201c;It was good seeing you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sit down. I know what happened with your wife. No witnesses except the guy who killed her. He says she ran the Stop sign. They had to cut her out with the Jaws of Life?&#x201d;<br> <br>I could feel blood veins tightening on the side of my head.<br> <br>&#x201c;She died on the way to the hospital and got blamed for her own death?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who told you this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Some cops. You got a dirty deal. Something ought to be done.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You need to disengage, Tony.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On top of it, I heard the guy tried to pump the insurance company. Shut the door.&#x201d;<br> <br>I leaned forward. &#x201c;Listen carefully, Tony. My wife&#x2019;s death is my business. You stay out of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mabel, shut the door!&#x201d; he yelled at his secretary. I raised my finger at him. I was trembling. I heard the door click shut behind me. He spoke before I could. &#x201c;Hear me out. The guy ran over a kid in a school zone in Alabama. The kid was crippled for life. You give me the nod, this guy is gonna be crawling around on stumps.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When did he run over a child in a school zone?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ten, fifteen years back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where in Alabama?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What difference does it make? I&#x2019;m telling you like it is. A guy like that has got it coming.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was like every gangster I ever knew. They&#x2019;re self-righteous and marginalize their victims before breaking their bones. Not one of them could think his way out of a wet paper bag. Their level of cruelty is equaled only by the level of disingenuousness that governs their lives.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want you to get this straight, Tony. Go near the man who hit my wife&#x2019;s car, and I&#x2019;ll come looking for you, up close and personal.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; He lit a cigarette with a paper match, cupping the flame. He threw the burnt match into the wastebasket. &#x201c;So fuck me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stood up and pulled the sword halfway from its scabbard, then slid it inside again. The guard was brass, molded like a metal basket with slits in it. It was incised with the names of three battles that took place during Stonewall Jackson&#x2019;s Shenandoah campaign, plus Cemetery Hill at Gettysburg, and extended protectively and cuplike over the back of my hand. The black leather on the grip was both soft and firm, wrapped with gold wire. I replaced the sword on Tony&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;I think the Broussard family would be honored and delighted if you gave this to them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m having a hard time processing this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I try to be your friend, and you&#x2019;re offended and make threats. If you were somebody else, we&#x2019;d have a different outcome here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So fuck both of us. Tell me something, Tony.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? How you should get rid of terminal assholitis?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you keep your office in a neighborhood like this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It looks like a moonscape. In the next storm, it&#x2019;s going underwater again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I like to stay close to the people. On that subject, I&#x2019;m backing a guy who might end up president of the United States. Want to know who that is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jimmy Nightingale. People have been talking political correctness in this country for too many years. There&#x2019;s gonna be a change. Fucking A.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Somehow I believe you, Tony.&#x201d;<br> <br>And that was probably the most depressing thought I&#x2019;d had in a long time.</p><h2>Firebrand:: The Life of Horace Liveright</h2><p>Chronicles the life of Horace Liveright, the creator of the Modern Library, while detailing his revolutionary business practices that shook up the publishing industry and impacted public opinions about intellectual literature. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>Tom Dardis is professor emeritus of English at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.Horace Liveright (1884-1933) lingers as one of the greats in U.S. publishing, though many in the business today would be hard put to remember why. This study by Dardis (Some Time in the Sun) puts him back into sharp focus: with initial ambitions as a playwright, Liveright went instead into the staid world of publishing near the end of WWI (almost simultaneously with Alfred Knopf) and shook it to its foundations. He was a hard-drinking gambler who loved books and authors, took great pleasure in their successes, nursed them in their failures, was always good for a handout in the form of an unearnable advance and was, in Ezra Pound's words, "a jewel of a publisher." Pound was one of his authors; he also published Eliot's The Waste Land, launched Faulkner, Hemingway and the Modern Library (which he sold to Bennett Cerf), stuck by Sherwood Anderson and Theodore Dreiser long after they became unprofitable, nurtured Bertrand Russell and had Nathanael West on his last list. He also battled censorship at a time when other publishers had no stomach for the fight. What brought Liveright low, after a dazzling 12-year run, was his profligacy. His offices, full of booze and chorus girls, looked like the scene of one long party, and profits from his frequent bestsellers seemed to melt away. What with his stock-market fliers, his attempts to be a Broadway producer and his unending generosity to his authors, Liveright's course lay steadily downward. Dardis tells his story with unfailing narrative drive and a fine blend of immediacy and perspective.

But what Disney insiders saw as a mismanaged family business looked to Wall Street like a prime takeover candidate; the family squabble set off a chain of events that had such formidable financiers as Saul Steinberg, the Bass Brothers, even Ivan Boesky grappling for keys to the Magic Kingdom. Taylor, of Manhattan Inc., provides a detailed, conference-call-by-conference-call account of the ensuing paper war, in a narrative as fast-paced and exciting as a classic Disney adventure, with the company itself playing the Hayley Mills part: the imperiled, innocent heroine who at the end emerges harried but unharmedand more than a little wiser for the wear. Keeping financial jargon to a minimum, Taylor makes the Byzantine mechanics of contemporary finance easy to follow, shedding light on the takeover phenomenon and on the risks facing companies whose dearest assets are the creative talents of their employees.

Full color.</p><p>After receiving a fine arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley and completing two years of graduate work in design at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, <b>Ruth Heller</b> (1923-2004) began her career designing wrapping paper, cocktail napkins, greeting cards, and coloring books. After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br> <br> She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br> <br> Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."Kindergarten-Grade 5 Heller, who celebrated collective nouns in A Cache of Jewels (Grossett, 1987) here gives similar treatment to verbs in singing verse with vibrant illustrations which fairly leap from the pages in double-page spreads. While verbs do not lend themselves easily to two-dimensional illustrations, and many of the concepts here are too advanced and abstract for the usual picture book age child, these illustrations and the design of the book have such appeal that even children to whom the words seem mostly gibberish will enjoy the rhythm and visual impact of the book. Older children will find it a painless and concise grammar lesson as well as a visual treat. Most of the verse flows smoothly, and the meanings are clear. Verbs illustrated are well chosen and not hackneyed. While the overall design of the book is outstanding, it is unfortunate (for library circulation) that the text continues on the endpapers. This book should be a boon to language arts teachers in the upper elementary grades as well as fun for all children and adults who love to play with language. Louise L. Sherman, Anna C.

She made her operatic debut (at the Met) as a last-minute replacement for a huge star, Lotte Lehmann. Varnay was 23, and the role was Sieglinde in <i>Die Walk�re</i>, opposite one of the greatest of all tenors, Lauritz Melchior. Though the attendant fanfare was drowned by events--Pearl Harbor was attacked the next day--she went on to a long and admired career.<p> If you're looking for bitchy gossip, this memoir will disappoint you. Varnay has an old-fashioned courtliness to her, and she has unfailingly glowing things to say about her colleagues--most of them. Rudolf Bing and Herbert von Karajan are pointed exceptions. Conflicts with the "austere Viennese martinet" Bing led to Varnay's absence from the Met for nearly 20 years. As the focus of her career shifted to Germany, she left New York and settled in Munich. (Though often thought to be Scandinavian--she was born in Sweden, to Hungarian parents--Varnay grew up in the United States.)</p><p> As much an actress as a singer, Varnay was praised for her powerful characterizations. She felt a kinship with Wieland Wagner, in many of whose productions she appeared at Bayreuth during the 1950s and '60s, and whose pursuit of dramatic truth mirrored her own. Varnay describes her method of probing a character, offering insights into each of her major roles. Her career had three phases: principal dramatic-soprano parts (Wagner's Br�nnhilde and Isolde, Beethoven's Leonore, Strauss's Elektra); character roles, frequently with a villainous tinge (Klytamnestra, Herodias); and finally--stretching into her late 70s--cameo appearances as maids or grandmothers.</p><p> Varnay's chatty narrative includes plenty of anecdotes about colleagues like Kirsten Flagstad and Birgit Nilsson. She amusingly tells of near-disasters onstage: the Tristan who falls asleep while she's singing the Liebestod, the blackout in the middle of a performance, the listing tree that the singers have to hold up by taking turns leaning against it. Although Varnay is enough of a diva to report carefully on all her accolades, she comes across as an unpretentious working woman with a delight in the wonderful artists she has collaborated with. The only complaint with the book: not enough pictures. <i>--David Olivenbaum</i></p>Astrid Varnay was born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1918.

Amidst the tumult and revolution that characterized the latter half of the 20th century in Latin America and the US, women artists were staking their claim in nearly every field. This wide ranging volume examines the work of more than 100 female artists with nearly 300 works in the fields of painting, sculpture, photography, video, performance art, and other experimental media. A series of thematic essays, arranged by country, address the cultural and political contexts in which these radical artists worked, while other essays address key issues such as feminism, art history, and the political body. Drawing its design and feel from the radical underground pamphlets, catalogs, and posters of the era, this is the first examination of a highly influential period in 20th-century art history.<br><br>Published in association with the Hammer Museum.</p><p>Cecilia Fajardo-Hill is an independent British-Venezuelan art historian and curator of modern and contemporary art, currently based in Southern California."<i>Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960-1985</i>, the catalog for an exhibition at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, is a historical must-have and a joy.

Warmly welcomed, he eventually became tutor to the Dalai Lama, teenaged god-king of the theocratic nation.

Here is reliable medicine for a fatal epidemic.</p><p>Ralph Venning was born in Devon around the year 1621 to Francis and Joanne Venning, and spent his childhood and early adult life in the vicinity of Tavistock, where his father was a yeoman farmer. There Venning encountered the Puritan preacher, George Hughes, under whose diligent pastoral ministry he was converted, along with two other young men who also went on to become gospel ministers. Venning later acknowledged the debt he owed to Hughes, whose devotion of time and energy both to Venning s conversion and early discipleship, led to him describing Hughes in affectionate terms as his spiritual father .<br><br>His academic and, perhaps, ministerial potential having been recognised, Venning left Devon for Cambridge. He was �admitted to Emmanuel College as a sizar in April 1643 a category of student which would have required him to carry out menial jobs around the college in part payment of his fees. Despite these additional duties he also served as chaplain in the Tower of London, and found the time to write and publish two books Venning completed his BA and MA degrees before entering into the preaching ministry.<br><br>Apart from a short period in Devon, Venning ministered primarily in London, in fellowship with both Independent and Presbyterian preachers such as Joseph Caryl, John Owen, Richard Baxter and George Griffith. Indeed, London was a hub for godly preaching at that time. Venning, although known for his moderation and as one who avoided partisanship, was unequivocally committed to the goals of the Reformation and of the Puritan revolution , and served in a number of capacities during the Commonwealth period and under the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. These included the Commissions for assessing candidates for chaplaincy posts in the navy and for the County of Surrey, as well as promoting evangelical enterprise amongst the indigenous peoples of New England. Of greatest importance to Venning, however, was the promotion of godliness in every aspect of daily life.<br><br>During the 1650s Venning was primarily occupied as Lecturer at St Olave s, Southwark. The church was fully demolished by 1928, and Olaf House, part of London Bridge �Hospital, now occupies the spot. Venning also ministered at St Mary Magdalen from 1657. In 1661 he married Hannah Cope, a widow; they had at least two children.Refusing to conform to the 1662 Act of Uniformity, Venning was ejected from this post. In the years that followed, he served as co-pastor with Robert Bragge to a nonconformist congregation which met at the Pewterers Guild Hall in Lime Street. His last sermon, after which he was taken ill and died (March 1674), was preached to a similar congregation meeting at Joiners Hall.<br><br>In addition to his ministry among the Reformed churches during the heady days of the 1650s, Venning also preached on occasions at Paul's Cross, an open air pulpit adjacent to St Paul's Cathedral, and described by historian Patrick Collinson as the seventeenth century equivalent of national broadcasting. Those who listened would have included the Aldermen and Mayor of London, as well as a broad spectrum of both Londoners and visitors to the capital. This was a platform to present to the widest possible audience sermons on matters of national importance. The Trust's Puritan Paperback The Way to True Happiness is a record of one such sermon.<br><br>Venning's works <em>The Sinfulness of Sin</em> and <em>Learning in Christ's School,/em&gt; are available in the Trust's Puritan Paperbacks series.<br><br>[Adapted from S. Bryn Roberts' 'Introduction' to <em>The Way to True Happiness,/em&gt;]</em></em>'Works like Ralph Venning's <em>The Sinfulness of Sin</em> have steered me into a greater understanding of God, his word, and indeed even my own heart. Few today would dare think so carefully and comprehensively about the Bible's teaching on the stuff of sin. Fewer still would dare write it. Perhaps even fewer have sat to read Venning's cogent study. But any who read this book will never think the same way about sin, evil, and God s grace in Christ Jesus. Thank you, Banner.' --<em>David Garner</em></p><h2>When Rabbit Howls</h2><p>In their own worlds, the multiple personalities altogether a total of more than eighty--inhabiting the body of Truddi Chase chronicle their struggle for existence in a life of sexual abuse and self-discovery</p><p><b>Truddi Chase </b>was&nbsp;the author of <i>When Rabbit Howls, </i>a personal account of her abusive upbringing and her struggle with dissociative identity disorder<i>.&nbsp;</i>She passed away in 2010.<b>Praise for <i>When Rabbit Howls</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Startling...stunning...powerful.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;The San Francisco Chronicle<br><br></i>&#x201c;Perhaps the most extraordinary victim of multiple personalities on record.

But Ebenezer is far from welcoming, and David narrowly escapes being murdered before he is kidnapped and imprisoned on a ship bound for the Carolinas. When the ship is wrecked, David, along with the fiery rebel Alan Breck, makes his way back across the treacherous Highland terrain on a quest for justice. Through his powerful depiction of the two very different central characters&#x2014;the romantic Breck and the rational Whig David&#x2014;Stevenson dramatized a conflict at the heart of Scottish culture in the aftermath of the Jacobite rebellion, as well as creating an unforgettable adventure story.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

His English publisher had excised many of the Scottish words and phrases he had used to evoke the suspense of the novel. From simple misreadings to deliberate revisions, subsequent printed editions represented major departures from Stevenson&#39;s handwritten text. Now Barry Menikoff has restored the author&#39;s language and punctuation, as well as the authentic Scots quality of his diction. In doing so, he has given readers a clearer picture of both Stevenson&#39;s skill as a storyteller and the novel&#39;s social and political context.For the better part of a century &#34;Kidnapped&#34; has occupied an ambiguous position in literary and cultural studies. Its initial appearance in a weekly magazine called &#34;Young Folks Paper,&#34; along with Stevenson&#39;s disingenuous comment that the novel had a diverting rather than a serious aim, have in effect trapped the book in the never-neverland of children&#39;s literature. Yet it is universally acknowledges as a classic of world literature and the novelist always considered it his finest achievement -- taken together with its sequel, &#34;David Balfour,&#34; the best he was capable of in fiction. Now, for the first readers can plainly see why Stevenson placed his story of David Balfour on so high a pedestal. Drawing on the unique autograph manuscript in California&#39;s Huntington Library, Professor Barry Menikoff faithfully reproduces the text as Stevenson originally wrote it, restoring the punctuation (of which the novelist was a master) and recovering the distinctive and often singular language that had been altered or deleted. The effect is to deepen and illuminate the Scottish texture of the novel. For a book so embedded in Scottish history as &#34;Kidnapped,&#34; so revelatory of its fierce loyalties and violent enmities, the discovery that Stevenson was even more nationalistic than we had known comes at an opportune moment, with the opening of the new Scottish parliament. This handsome new edition of a novel whose avowed purpose was the recovery of an important part of Scots history reproduces for the first time the original drawings that accompanied the text during its serialization in &#34;Young Folks.&#34; Professor Menikoff&#39;s substantial introduction situates the book in its cultural context, and enables us to see why Stevenson&#39;s contemporaries were both entranced and awed by his achievement. And in his extensive notes to the novel he reveals Stevenson&#39;s enormous prestige as an authority on language, both English and Scots, for &#34;Kidnapped&#34; was widely drawn upon as a reference by lexicographers for the &#34;Oxford English Dictionary&#34; and the &#34;Scottish National Dictionary.&#34; Finally, for a tale that charts the &#34;wanderings&#34; of David Balfour over the land and seas of Scotland, this edition is the first to provide a gazetteer of place-names encountered during the course of those travels.</p><h2>Steven Universe Original Graphic Novel: Camp Pining Play</h2><p>Peridot--along with Steven, Lars, and Lapis--puts on a play based on Camp Pining Hearts, a cult classic television series in the Steven Universe world.<br><br>IT&#x2019;S SHOWTIME!<br> <br>When Peridot and Lapis discover Camp Pining Play fanfiction, they fall in love with Lars&#x2019; secret story and decide to put on a live performance for Beach City!

Written with freelancer Shrake in salty and sometimes vulgar language, Nelson's reflections on his three wives, children, his country music peers and others in his large, floating entourage reveal a hard-living man. The singer toiled in the fields as a child during the Depression, was left by his teenage parents with grandparents who raised him and his sister in Texas. The experience was pivotal to his career: "My desire to escape from manual labor started in the cotton fields of my childhood and cannot be overstated." Nelson began his road life as "an itinerant singer and guitar picker" on trips punctuated with alcohol, drugs and sex as he climbed to eminence in the world of country music. Now "crossed over," popular with national audiences, Nelson notes that he enjoys all the personal perquisites of his success. Among his revelations here, the singer recalls smoking pot on the roof of the White House after entertaining at a Carter state dinner. Photos not seen by PW.

Kennedy, Jr.</h2><p>The last, defining years of the life of John F. Kennedy, Jr., as seen by an editor who worked for him at <i>George</i> magazine.<br><br>At thirty-four, better known for his social life than his work as an assistant district attorney, John F. Kennedy, Jr., was still a man in search of his destiny. All that changed in 1995, when Kennedy launched a bold new magazine about American politics, puckishly called <i>George</i>. Over the next four years, Kennedy's passionate commitment to the magazine -- and to the ideals it stood for -- transformed him.<br><br>One witness to this transformation was Richard Blow, an editor and writer who joined <i>George</i> several months before the release of its first issue. During their four years together, Blow observed his boss rise to enormous challenges -- starting a risky new business, managing the pressures that attend a high public profile, and beginning life as a married man. With Blow as our surrogate, we see the many sides of Kennedy's personality: the rebel who fearlessly takes on politicians and pundits; the gentleman who sends gracious thank-you notes to his colleagues for their wedding gifts; the vulnerable son occasionally at odds with a mythic family legacy; the leader who stays true to his vision, no matter how difficult the circumstances.<br><br>Simply and sympathetically, Blow offers an affecting portrait of a complicated man at last coming into his own -- sometimes gracefully, sometimes under siege, but never without the burden of great expectations.<br></p><p>Richard Blow was an editor of R<i>egardie's</i> magazine in Washington, D.C., from 1993 to 1995. He joined the staff of <i>George </i>several months before publication of its first issue and worked there until 2000.

Even from where I stood, way up on the balcony, I could feel it, that powerful, unexpected blurring of the iconic and the actual, the life-movie and real life. There was a collective intake of breath, as if everyone in the room suddenly took a step back. For half a heartbeat, the reporters stopped seeing John as a commodity and connected with him as a person, an orphan who, rich and famous though he may have been, had to make his way in the world like all the rest of us. <br><br>Then someone else raised his hand and the moment vanished.<br></p><h2>Keeping Our Children&#39;s Hearts : Our Vital Priority</h2><p>&#34;Written for Parents of young children to teenagers, this book shares the joys and outcomes of our vital priority-keeping our children&#39;s hearts.

He cleared his throat like a senator about to introduce a bill, and said, with great ceremony, &#x201c;Jackie is being mean to me, Mommy.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An expression of annoyance briefly crossed Sheila&#x2019;s face; its passage was so fast that Eliza Barnes wasn&#x2019;t sure if she&#x2019;d imagined it or not. It was June, the last day of school, and already hot. They were at the club. Someone had ordered a round of Bloody Marys, which were sweating as much as the women themselves, though the women did it more delicately. Even the celery in Eliza&#x2019;s drink seemed to have given up, allowing itself to slip in an undignified manner into the tomato juice. Sheila held up a hand to the women and said, &#x201c;To be <i>continued,</i>&#x201d; before turning to her son and stage--whispering, &#x201c;Edward, you did absolutely the right thing, telling me politely instead of screaming, it&#x2019;s just that Mommy was in the middle of a story&#x2014;-&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that someone&#x2019;s phone?&#x201d; asked Jodi Sanders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care,&#x201d; said Catherine Cooper. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s mine, I&#x2019;m letting it ring and ring. It&#x2019;s summer vacation! I&#x2019;m off duty.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; said Eliza. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sort of <i>on</i> duty, now that it&#x2019;s summer vacation, wouldn&#x2019;t you say?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got two words for you, Eliza,&#x201d; said Jodi. &#x201c;Summer. Nanny.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hear, hear,&#x201d; said Sheila. Her Bloody Mary was gone; she flagged the pale wren of a girl who was serving that day and asked her for another. &#x201c;Kristi Osgood is home from McGill.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I already hired her,&#x201d; said Deirdre Palmer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Figures,&#x201d; said Sheila. &#x201c;You need her for your one perfect, well--behaved Sofia.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;She does!&#x201d; said Eliza. &#x201c;You have no idea how much work this EANY gala is for Deirdre.&#x201d; East Africa Needs You, Deirdre&#x2019;s pet project. Deirdre and Eliza went way back&#x2014;-all the way to a breast-feeding class they took at the hospital soon after Sofia and Zoe were born. Sofia and Eliza&#x2019;s oldest daughter, Zoe, had no choice but to be best friends, really; their friendship had such auspicious, intimate beginnings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Eenie, meenie, miney, moe,&#x201d; said Sheila, one hand on her son&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Anyway. To continue what I was saying. What was I saying?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Mom,&#x201d;</i> said Eddie. &#x201c;I mean <i>really mean,</i> let me just tell you what&#x2014;-&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sheila emitted a small frustrated huff, made a sun visor out of her hand, and peered at her son. After a quarter of a minute she stood and led him firmly to a secluded spot farther from the pool where she crouched in front of him and gesticulated wildly. Eliza could see Eddie nodding, then shaking his head, then nodding again, before turning away and trudging back toward the knot of kids by the pool, a doleful sag to his skinny shoulders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eliza scanned the pool area for Zoe and her other daughter, Evie; Sofia and Zoe were reluctantly and temporarily allowing Evie&#x2019;s ten--year--old earth to orbit their thirteen--year--old sun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever Eliza pointed out that she herself would have given her eyesight or at least three of her toes for a sister when <i>she</i> was growing up, Zoe let her eyes drift into an almost--roll that she always caught at the last second. Because she knew that Eliza&#x2019;s loss of her own mother when she was so very young (only twelve! Younger than Zoe was now!) had induced in Eliza a pain that had faded over time but had never gone away, that still&#x2014;-often&#x2014;-came out of nowhere to strike at her wrathfully and unforgivingly, like a rheumatoid arthritis flare--up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eliza had not had the vocabulary at the time to define the effects of her mother&#x2019;s death. But she understood, then and now, on a deep and primordial level that every day after the event would become a search for the thing she&#x2019;d lost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a result: lots of therefores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>�Therefore, Eliza would be the best mother possible, because she was alive to be so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>�Therefore, she would appreciate each and every day, no matter what it brought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>�Therefore, she would take exquisite care of herself: omega--3s, mammograms, the occasional green juice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>�Therefore, she would kiss her daughters good night and tell them she loved them even on days that they infuriated her or left their dirty clothes on the bathroom floor and hair balls in the shower drain. <i>All of which they did.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eliza lifted her face to the sun and let the voices of the women around her fade into the background. Jodi was asking, &#x201c;Whose phone <i>is</i> that?&#x201d; Sheila was ranting, &#x201c;Honestly, if they spend all summer bickering I&#x2019;m going to hire <i>two separate nannies</i> and spend the whole summer <i>by myself</i> in Hyannis,&#x201d; and Catherine was saying something about how Henry was incensed about the increase in docking fees at the club this year and how some people were starting to look elsewhere; didn&#x2019;t the <i>superior beings</i> who ran the club know that they couldn&#x2019;t just do that without <i>any warning</i>?&#x2014;-some people did not have <i>unlimited funds</i> with which to dock their boats. Not that it was a problem for the Coopers, of course, but what if it was a problem for others?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eliza breathed in, breathed out. Sun on her face on a June day. Drinks in the early afternoon, carrying with them a sensation of illicitness that made them taste even better, like the women were all teenagers, getting away with something while their parents had their heads turned the other way. Cosseted offspring splashing gleefully about in the safe confines of the yacht club pool, slathered in expensive sunscreen, clad in swimsuits that ranged from adorable (Evie, rocking a mini Boden one--piece with age--appropriate polka dots) to borderline tasteless (Jackie Rackley, also thirteen, in a bikini that looked ready for Copacabana). Who would have thought that this, any of this, was what the future held for a lobsterman&#x2019;s daughter?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eliza didn&#x2019;t want to open her eyes, because if she did, if she caught the glance of Jodi or Catherine or Sheila, one of them might whisper aloud what Eliza was sure they all thought of her secretly. <i>Interloper,</i> they&#x2019;d say. <i>You don&#x2019;t belong here.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That was something she&#x2019;d been feeling lately a lot more than usual, and for that she blamed Phineas Tarbox. A ridiculous name, <i>Phineas Tarbox.</i> An actual Boston Brahmin, the real deal. His office was on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston&#x2019;s Back Bay, not far from Judith&#x2019;s home. Judith was Eliza&#x2019;s mother--in--law. In fact, Phineas had been recommended by Judith, <i>of course,</i> like many things in their lives were. Judith was the unseen conductor of their orchestra, always calmly moving her baton.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was after their visit to Phineas Tarbox that Eliza felt something dark, almost sinister, creep into her marriage. An unwelcome guest. It wasn&#x2019;t just that Rob was busy and distracted with a big work project, often too tired at the end of the day to do anything but fall into bed, although that was true, or that the girls gobbled up time and energy from both of them, which was also true, and expected. It was something more. It was that sometimes she looked at him, this man she&#x2019;d been married to for so many years, this man whose body was so familiar to her that she&#x2019;d recognize even the crease of his elbow if shown a photograph of only that, and she saw a stranger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Eliza!&#x201d;</i> said Sheila. &#x201c;Wake up, that&#x2019;s <i>your</i> phone that&#x2019;s been ringing this whole time.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What? <i>Oh.</i> Oh geez, sorry.&#x201d; Eliza scanned the pool again, located Evie, who was following Zoe around like a pup tracking its mother, and dug in her mammoth pool bag for her phone. A Maine area code. Only her father called her from Maine, and this wasn&#x2019;t his number on the caller ID.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Eliza?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This is Eliza.&#x201d; The voice on the other end was familiar in a way that seemed thrice removed from her ordinary life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Liza, it&#x2019;s Russell.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Something somersaulted&#x2014;-one of her organs. Could organs somersault? Many years ago, Eliza had completed two years of medical school at Boston University, so she knew that they couldn&#x2019;t. Not that you really needed the medical training to know that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Russell Perkins?&#x201d; She had to get up from her lounge chair and walk away to shield herself from the other women, who had fallen silent, sensing from Eliza&#x2019;s tone, both voice and skin, that <i>something dramatic</i> was about to happen. Or, maybe, had already happened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the one,&#x201d; said Russell Perkins, Eliza Barnes&#x2019;s first love, her knight in shining armor, the Bruce Springsteen to her Mary. Zillions of memories flooded her: a pickup truck, a barn in winter, half of her clothes off, new desire. A nearly deserted island in summer, the inside of a car, a room in Bangor. She was sixteen again, seventeen, eighteen, all in a matter of seconds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She glanced back at the women, who had returned to their conversation but were stealing occasional tastefully curious glances at Eliza, glances that said both <i>We are here for you if you need us</i> and <i>Are we missing something good?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Listen, Liza, you might want to get yourself up to Little Harbor just as quick as you can.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Ohmygod,</i> thought Eliza. Her legs almost gave out and she had to lean against the fence that enclosed the pool. It was happening. Her dad was gone. He&#x2019;d been pulled overboard by a trap. He&#x2019;d had a heart attack, or a stroke, or a fight that went wrong. He&#x2019;d rolled his truck over on the way home from the bar. It was bound to happen, each of those evil creatures was waiting in the wings to lay their pronged teeth into Charlie Sargent&#x2019;s skin. Hazards of the job, of the lifestyle, the pay grade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All those years they spent together, just the two of them, leaning on each other. All those chicken cutlet dinners she&#x2019;d prepared, and now he was gone. She was officially an orphan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Could you be a thirty--seven--year--old orphan?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Liza?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She croaked out something that tried to be a word but didn&#x2019;t make it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Your dad hit his head on the boat this morning, the Coast Guard had to go out and bring him back in. Val took him to the emergency room, his arm was hurt too.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;He called the Coast Guard?&#x201d; Her dad would never call the Coast Guard, not unless it was a <i>very serious emergency.</i> She italicized the words in her mind because that&#x2019;s the way her dad always said them to her. You take care of things yourself unless it&#x2019;s a <i>very serious emergency, </i>Eliza.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t let anyone help him. He&#x2019;d never tell you himself that he needs you, so I&#x2019;m telling you. He needs you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eliza recalculated. She wasn&#x2019;t a thirty--seven--year--old orphan. She wasn&#x2019;t an orphan at all. But her dad needed her. She turned back toward the lounge chairs. She could see that Sheila Rackley was finally completing her story and that it had been a doozy. Deirdre had her hand over her mouth, and her narrow, bronzed shoulders were shaking with laughter. Even Catherine Cooper, who was a tough audience, was smiling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Liza?&#x201d; said Russell, and her stomach twisted again in that unsettling way. Nobody else called her Liza.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said. She cleared her throat. She turned toward the pool and saw Zoe standing at the edge of the diving board. She felt the same urge she always felt, to call out <i>Don&#x2019;t jump!</i> because bad things could happen on diving boards and she wanted to protect her children from every possible danger. She fought the same impulse each time she watched them buckle themselves into the backseat of a friend&#x2019;s car and wave at her nonchalantly. <i>Don&#x2019;t go!</i> she always wanted to say. <i>Stay here with me, where you&#x2019;ll be safe!</i> The world was full of untold menaces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zoe executed a perfect swan dive, which had been honed by hours of practice and the assistance of a <i>personal dive coach.</i> Eliza knew that was ridiculous. Yet because of the coaching the dive was gorgeous. Eliza kept her eyes on the water until Zoe&#x2019;s head popped up (because you never knew) and felt the odd combination of pride and wonderment she often felt watching her daughters. It was almost envy, although she&#x2019;d never say that out loud, because that was embarrassing. The things they knew how to do, the professional instruction they&#x2019;d received in their young lives! Skiing, tennis, sailing&#x2014;-pastimes that had been so far off Eliza&#x2019;s radar when she was a child that she had thought only kids in movies engaged in them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said again. &#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll get up there as soon as I can. I just have to figure out a couple of things, make some arrangements for Zoe and Evie. For my daughters.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Eliza was Zoe&#x2019;s age all she knew how to do was row a skiff from the wharf to her dad&#x2019;s boat, the <i>Joanie B,</i> named after Eliza&#x2019;s mother, and how to use the gauge to measure the lobsters, and how to V--notch the pregnant females. She could also crack a lobster like nobody&#x2019;s business, pull every scrap of meat out, wasting not even a fraction of an ounce. Not exactly a useful skill set in Barton, although once, admittedly, at a midsummer yacht club clambake she&#x2019;d had one too many gin and tonics and had made the rounds with her double--jaw lobster crackers, allowing herself to be timed by Deirdre&#x2019;s husband, Brock. (In her defense, the gin and tonics at the club were very strong.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay? Thank you for calling, Russell. Thank you, really.&#x201d; Her organs did that strange gymnastics again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Last she knew of Russell he&#x2019;d moved up to Bangor and was training to go into sales. Life insurance, or something equally necessary and staid. Life insurance! Russell Perkins, one of the best lobstermen Little Harbor had ever seen. It was <i>outrageous.</i> Must be that that hadn&#x2019;t stuck, that he&#x2019;d come back. The good ones always came back. They couldn&#x2019;t really figure out any other way to live&#x2014;-they didn&#x2019;t want to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eliza stood for a moment holding the phone. She wasn&#x2019;t sure what to do next, call the children over to her, or go back to her bag, to start getting her things organized, or call Rob, who she knew was in the middle of a meeting with his client, the indomitable Mrs. Cabot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eliza was for a moment quite paralyzed. Fresh Bloody Marys had arrived at the table, and Deirdre brought one to Eliza, first putting it into her hand, and then closing Eliza&#x2019;s fingers around the ...</p></p><h2>Muddigush</h2><p>Describes the squishy sensations associated with playing in the mud</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 2-- A rainy day, a small child, and a poetic text create or re-create an outdoor experience for youngsters.

The hardy souls who first answered that call endured bitter temperatures, maddening isolation, and often harrowing adventures for the privilege of living there, and many lost their lives in the process. From the earliest human explorers to Russian fur trappers, from Klondike gold seekers to today's miners and oilmen, from Alaska's native people to the millions of tourists who visit the state every year, people have come to Alaska to marvel at its beauty, rejoice in its riches, and measure themselves against its challenges. The wonder of Alaska, as well as its terrifying dangers, come to life in this anthology, featuring true adventures described by some of the best writers in the world, each hand picked by bestselling writer and Alaska aficionado Spike Walker. <i>Alaska: Tales of Adventure from the Last Frontier</i> will open your eyes and stir your soul as it celebrates the untamed beauty of Alaska.</p><p>Inside you will find unmatched tales of adventure by the following authors:</p><p>Spike Walker<br>Jack London<br>Larry Kaniut<br>Roger A.

He has voyaged across storm-tossed seas from the ports of Kodiak in the Gulf of Alaska to Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands and north, across the Bering Sea, to the edge of the polar ice cap in search of king crab, halibut, and codfish. His first book,<i> Working on the Edge</i>, was hailed by James Michener as "the definitive account of this peilous trade." With his books <i>Nights of Ice </i>and <i>Coming Back Alive</i>, Spike Walker's growing reputation as one of America's greatest authors of true Alaskan adventure tales has been firmly established.</p>This anthology of 31 stories chronicling Alaskan life, past and present, includes pieces by such noted writers as Washington Irving, John Muir, Jack London, and Gary Paulsen. Irving describes the voyage of a sailing vessel in 1812; Muir writes about one of his trips to Glacier Bay; London's subjects range from gold hunters to building a fire in 75-below temperatures; and Paulsen tells what it is like to race in the Iditarod, the 1,100-mile odyssey that tests the endurance of both humans and dogs. There is an excerpt from the <i>Dawson Daily News</i> of May 23, 1900, reporting on the dog nuisance in that city, and an excerpt from <i>Alaska Magazine</i> on the plethora of carnivorous bugs. A piece by editor Walker, author of <i>Coming Back Alive</i> [BKL Ag 01], describes a man's escape from a sinking fishing boat and his mental battle to stay alive for 27 hours in the deadly cold Gulf of Alaska Sea. Selections from oral histories by four native Alaskans round out the collection. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Earth is ruled by master-machines but the Three Laws of Robotics have been designed to ensure humans maintain the upper hand: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or allow a human being to come to harm 2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. But what happens when a rogue robot&#39;s idea of what is good for society contravenes the Three Laws?</p><p>In this collection, one of the great classics of science fiction, Asimov set out the principles of robot behavior that we know as the Three Laws of Robotics.

Financialization over the past three decades has created a structure that lacks resilience and supports absurd volumes of trading. The finance sector devotes too little attention to the search for new investment opportunities and the stewardship of existing ones, and far too much to secondary-market dealing in existing assets. Regulation has contributed more to the problems than the solutions. <br>Why? What is finance for? John Kay, with wide practical and academic experience in the world of finance, understands the operation of the financial sector better than most. He believes in good banks and effective asset managers, but good banks and effective asset managers are not what he sees. <br>In a dazzling and revelatory tour of the financial world as it has emerged from the wreckage of the 2008 crisis, Kay does not flinch in his criticism: we do need some of the things that Citigroup and Goldman Sachs do, but we do not need Citigroup and Goldman to do them. And many of the things done by Citigroup and Goldman do not need to be done at all. The finance sector needs to be reminded of its primary purpose: to manage other people's money for the benefit of businesses and households. It is an aberration when the some of the finest mathematical and scientific minds are tasked with devising algorithms for the sole purpose of exploiting the weakness of other algorithms for computerized trading in securities. To travel further down that road leads to ruin.</p><p><b>John Kay</b>, is a visiting professor of economics at the London School of Economics and a fellow of St John s College, Oxford University.

And it is the story of Miggery Sow, a slow-witted serving girl with a simple, impossible wish. These characters are about to embark on a journey that will lead them down into a horrible dungeon, up into a glittering castle, and ultimately, into each other's lives.</p></p><p>Kate DiCamillo, author of the Newbery Honor book <i>Because of Winn-Dixie</i>, spins a tidy tale of mice and men where she explores the "powerful, wonderful, and ridiculous" nature of love, hope, and forgiveness. Her old-fashioned, somewhat dark story, narrated "Dear Reader"-style, begins "within the walls of a castle, with the birth of a mouse." Despereaux Tilling, the new baby mouse, is different from all other mice. Sadly, the romantic, unmouselike spirit that leads the unusually tiny, large-eared mouse to the foot of the human king and the beautiful Princess Pea ultimately causes him to be banished by his own father to the foul, rat-filled dungeon.<p> The first book of four tells Despereaux's sad story, where he falls deeply in love with Princess Pea and meets his cruel fate. The second book introduces another creature who differs from his peers--Chiaroscuro, a rat who instead of loving the darkness of his home in the dungeon, loves the light so much he ends up in the castle&amp; in the queen's soup. The third book describes young Miggery Sow, a girl who has been "clouted" so many times that she has cauliflower ears. Still, all the slow-witted, hard-of-hearing Mig dreams of is wearing the crown of Princess Pea. The fourth book returns to the dungeon-bound Despereaux and connects the lives of mouse, rat, girl, and princess in a dramatic denouement.</p><p> Children whose hopes and dreams burn secretly within their hearts will relate to this cast of outsiders who desire what is said to be out of their reach and dare to break "never-to-be-broken rules of conduct." Timothy Basil Ering's pencil illustrations are stunning, reflecting DiCamillo's extensive light and darkness imagery as well as the sweet, fragile nature of the tiny mouse hero who lives happily ever after.

He has exceptionally large ears.&#x2019; &#x2018;What happens to this hero?&#x2019; I asked. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s why I want you to write it down, so we can find out.&#x2019; Well, Luke Bailey, three years later, here is the story of what happened to your exceptionally large-eared, unlikely hero."<br><br>Timothy Basil Ering is the author and illustrator of THE STORY OF FROG BELLY RAT BONE, and he also created the cover image and interior black-and-white drawings for 33 SNOWFISH by Adam Rapp. Of his inspiration for the illustrations in The TALE OF DESPEREAUX, he says, "My mother may have been a mouse in her past life, as I watched her save and help so many mice in our house while I was growing up. The illustrations I&#x2019;ve done of Despereaux Tilling are, in a way, my tribute to her."

I know that sounds rather dramatic&#x2014;�sort of like: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Trust me, I&#x2019;ve been through both, but then I suspect everyone who breathes in oxygen has experienced this.<br><br> I started my career as a bank teller and eventually worked my way into the corporate office, taking on more and more responsibility. I liked my job and advanced quickly, but that driving ambition to succeed came with a price. I got so wrapped up and focused on my career I didn&#x2019;t have time for relationships. Oh, I had a few close friends, but when it came to dating and true love, I blew it off, thinking there would be time for all of that later.<br><br> Then one day I woke up and discovered the majority of my friends were married and raising families. When I did become interested in finding my soulmate, the men I dated, well, suffice it to say, and I&#x2019;m being as kind as I can be, were a sorry disappointment.<br><br> Then I met Paul Rose and I fell head over heels in love. Within the first week I knew he was the one. He was career military and hadn&#x2019;t married, either. It felt like a miracle that I would meet this wonderful man when I&#x2019;d given up hope of ever finding anyone.<br><br> Just like the lyrics of a country western song, we got married in a fever. Paul was an Airborne Ranger and a few months after he placed a diamond ring on my finger he shipped off to Afghanistan, then died in a helicopter crash.<br><br> It was as if life had hit me with an atom bomb.<br><br> My husband, whom I&#x2019;d loved so briefly, was forever gone from me. I&#x2019;ve read books that talk about the different stages of grief. They were filled with good advice, most of which I ignored. I was in so much emotional pain that I could barely function. It took every ounce of energy I could muster to force myself out of bed. Overnight everything, and I do mean everything, that I&#x2019;d once considered important&#x2014;�my career, my home, my lifestyle, my hopes and dreams of one day having a family with Paul&#x2014;�was gone in the blink of an eye.<br><br> Poof, destroyed.<br><br> Still reeling from the loss, I did the opposite of what everyone told me: Don&#x2019;t make an important decision the first year after the death of someone close. On a complete whim, I quit my corporate job and purchased a bed-�and-�breakfast and named it after my deceased husband. It became known as the Rose Harbor Inn. Rose, naturally, for Paul. And harbor because I&#x2019;d gambled that this next unexpected curve in the roadway of my life would become a harbor of healing for me. And, thankfully, it has. As a bonus, it seems the inn has the power to help others heal as well.<br><br> I seldom mention this insight to people for fear they&#x2019;ll suggest I consider counseling. Even now, almost four years later, I sometimes wonder if I&#x2019;d imagined that first night I spent after moving in. I&#x2019;d been half asleep . . . it might have been a dream. You know the kind where you aren&#x2019;t really asleep but not fully awake, either? Paul came to me in that dreamlike state, so real I was afraid to breathe for fear he would disappear. It felt as if all I had to do was reach out and touch him, but I knew I dared not.<br><br> While it was enough that he stood next to me, and I could see him and feel his love for me, as a bonus he spoke. Not that I heard the words out loud; they were spoken inside of me, in my heart.<br><br> I know it&#x2019;s hard to believe, but I swear that&#x2019;s what happened. He told me as plain as anything that I would heal here and all those who came to stay would find solace and healing of their own. Authentic or not, I&#x2019;ve held on to that promise, clung to it with both hands, desperately wanting it to be true. Desperately needed hope, a reason to continue.<br><br> When Paul told me I&#x2019;d heal, the last thing in my mind and certainly in my heart was the possibility of falling in love again. Finding Paul was miracle enough; I certainly didn&#x2019;t expect I could be so lucky again. But discovering love a second time was even more of a surprise than it was the first time. Certainly my relationship with Mark Taylor didn&#x2019;t start out as a lovefest, but I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself.<br><br> After my husband was killed, I retreated from life, which in retrospect is perfectly understandable. For two years I lived in a shell. I took up knitting and gardening, adopted a dog named Rover. All of these were things I&#x2019;d never have considered in my previous life.<br><br> The one constant the first two years I owned the inn was Mark Taylor, my handyman. He was grumpy, noncommunicative, and sometimes downright unpleasant. But as time progressed, Mark became a friend. I still found him irritating, but in a comforting sort of way. I suppose that doesn&#x2019;t make much sense, but it&#x2019;s the best way I can think to describe my feelings. In truth, it&#x2019;s hard to explain.<br><br> Mark was around the inn a lot, mainly because I hired him to do a variety of projects and odd jobs. After a while, despite our clashes and differences of opinion, we grudgingly became friends. We argued, but our disagreements weren&#x2019;t serious. I enjoyed teasing him. He loved my home-�baked cookies, and I found I could get him to do most anything with the promise of hot-�from-�the-�oven sweets.<br><br> The first time I laughed after learning about Paul was with Mark. He&#x2019;d been painting, and when climbing down the ladder he stuck his foot into a five-�gallon paint bucket. I thought it was hilarious and laughed until tears rained down my cheeks. Mark, however, wasn&#x2019;t amused.<br><br> Over the years he took on a number of projects I wanted done around the inn, which included building a rose garden and gazebo. I saw him nearly every day, and often more than once. Spending time with Mark became part of my daily routine. Even when he worked elsewhere he would invariably stop by the inn for coffee. We routinely sat on the porch and chatted about our day. There were times when we said nothing at all. We didn&#x2019;t seem to need words to communicate. Certainly there was no hint of romance; he was a friend and that was what I preferred. I was completely oblivious to the fact he might have come to care for me as more than that.<br><br> Just as I was coming out of my self-�enclosed shell, Mark let me know that he&#x2019;d fallen in love with me. His words shook me as powerfully as the 2001 Seattle earthquake. And then it hit me . . . and when I say that, I mean the shock of it turned me upside down. I discovered Mark had become more than a friend to me, too. Bottom line: I&#x2019;d fallen in love with him. It&#x2019;d been gradual&#x2014;�so gradual, in fact, that I wasn&#x2019;t even aware of the subtle shift of my feelings for him. This was so utterly different from falling in love with Paul that I remained oblivious to what had happened until Mark revealed his love for me.<br><br> No sooner did I come to accept that my heart was open and ready for Mark&#x2019;s love when he hit me with another shock. This one even bigger than the first. He announced he was leaving Cedar Cove, with no intention of returning.<br><br> What?<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t have a clue what that was about. He made no sense.<br><br> &#x201c;I love you, Jo Marie. Sorry, but I&#x2019;m leaving and I won&#x2019;t be back.&#x201d;<br><br> Who does that? And for the love of heaven, why? And then he was gone. Really gone. Sold-�his-�house gone. Gave-�his-�belongings-�away gone. Simply gone.</p><h2>The View from the Center of the Universe: Discovering Our Extraordinary Place in the Cosmos</h2><p>Draws on recent advances in astronomy, physics, and cosmology to present a theory of how to understand the universe and the role of our own world, in an account that offers insight into the origins and evolutionary coherence of the universe as well as its spiritual significance. 60,000 first printing.</p><p>Joel R. Primack, Ph.D., is an award-winning professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and is one of the most respected researchers in his field. He was one of the principal originators and developers of the theory of Cold Dark Matter, and is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. <br><br> Nancy Ellen Abrams is an award-winning science philosopher, a writer, an artist, and a lawyer whose work has appeared in journals, magazines, and books.If greeting card poet Susan Polis Schultz wrote about physics and the universe, this is the book she would produce. Filled with simplistic observations ("In their hearts most people are still living in an imagined universe where... we humans have no special place and often feel insignificant") as well as romantic cheerleading ("We need to overflow with gratitude that our universe... is filled with light and possibilities"), it offers cosmology disguised as a self-help guide to the universe. The authors&#x2014;Primack is a physicist at UC&#x2013;Santa Cruz, and Abrams is a philosopher of science&#x2014;contend that Newton's picture of the universe as shapeless and endless left humans feeling cosmically homeless, but in response they articulate a Peter Pan physics in which humans are intimately related to the universe because we are made of stardust, i.e., we're an integral part of the cosmos. Our place in the universe is extraordinary, they claim, because the universe will never be in this moment of time again, and we have a responsibility to take care of the Earth since there is still time to solve some of our cosmic problems. Attempting to weave science and spirituality into one cosmic fabric, the authors satisfy the reader in neither realm.

TV tie-in.</p><p>Abba Eban was born in Cape Town, South Africa in 1915, and educated at Cambridge University. He began his governmental career in 1948 as a United Nations representative for the provisional government of Israel, becoming permanent representative in 1949, a post he held for ten years. From 1950 to 1959 he concurrently served as Israeli Ambassador to the United States. In Israel, Eban has at various times held the position of Minister without Portfolio, Minister of Education and Culture, Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister of Foreign Affairs, as well as the presidency of the Weiszmann Institute of Science, and has been a member of the Knesset. He is the author of a number of books of history, politics, biography and memoir, and many articles.This gripping political memoir by the former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. and U.N. affords a privileged view of history being made. It begins as Eban, a British army captain during WW II, undertakes a mission to Jerusalem where he helps create an independent Jewish fighting force in the face of the horrific prospect of a Nazi-German conquest of Palestine. Eban, who also served as Israeli foreign minister, writes movingly of the birth of Israel in a war fought with Czech weapons because of Truman's arms embargo against the fledgling Jewish state. Eban suggests that U.S. military support could have prevented the Suez-Sinai War of 1956. He discloses Israel's strenuous behind-the-scenes efforts to prevent the 1967 Six Day War. Viewing both Arabs and Israelis as paralyzed by the weight of their historic experience, he urges the creation of a Palestinian self-governing entity, perhaps confederated with Jordan. Tied to a PBS-TV series, these stirring reminiscences are peppered with candid firsthand impressions of Ben-Gurion, Churchill, Sadat, Einstein, Gorbachev, Kissinger and dozens of others.

That storied episode, which historian Richard Overy deems a stalemate rather than a decisive triumph, has been layered with legends, one being that the RAF's determined resistance was the key factor in repelling an impending Nazi invasion. It now appears that that was never a real possibility. Another legend was that the RAF was badly outnumbered and outgunned. In fact, as Overy details, the German and British air forces were fairly evenly matched, and the RAF sustained fewer losses than it delivered.<p> Overy's slender, well-written study of the Battle of Britain celebrates the very real accomplishments of the RAF and, its revisionism aside, acknowledges that the Battle of Britain was a true turning point in the history of World War II. Overy holds that one of its most important results was to lead influential Americans to urge that the United States take Britain's side, a fact that would soon be realized. More important, though, the Battle of Britain kept England in the war at a time when many politicians and citizens sought some accommodation with the Nazi regime. It galvanized popular opposition to Hitler, replacing uncertainties and disagreements with "a greater sense of purpose and a more united people." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Richard Overy</b> is professor of modern history at King's College, London.

As such, these eighteen essays, centered on art and memory, offer an investigation into form and content and the language of innocence, experience, and loss. Four sections (each borrowing names from the sculptures of Degas, Bernini, and Rodin) frame a series of meditations that consider the boundaries of the discernible world and the extremes of the body and the self. Here Parms draws heavily on memories of a Bronx upbringing in the 1980s and1990s; explorations in Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and the American West; the struggle to comprehend race, love, family, madness, and nostalgia; and the unending influence of art, poetry, and music.</p><p>Written largely within the galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, <i>Lost Wax</i> is an inquiry into the ways we curate memory and human experience despite the limits of observation and language.

Because when your protein sources come from animals, you&#x2019;re missing out on all of the nutritional benefits of a plant-based diet&#x2014;a diet that can make you more fit, more sexy, and more manly.&nbsp;??</p><p>In&nbsp;<em>Meat is for Pussies</em>, Joseph presents a throw-down of information, offering both personal and scientific evidence that a plant-based diet offers the best path to athleticism, endurance, strength, and overall health. In addition to handily dispelling the myths surrounding meat, Joseph offers workout advice, a meal plan, and recipes that make going plant-based easy. Flavor and vitamin-packed options like the Working Man Stew and Veggie Chili with Cornbread will keep men&#x2019;s (and women&#x2019;s) bodies healthy and energized, while workouts that emphasize cardio and strength training build endurance and stamina and prove that you don&#x2019;t need meat to build muscle.??</p><p>Joseph also offers living proof that living a plant-based lifestyle is badass, from super-athlete Brendan Brazier to MMA champion Jake Shields to Joseph himself, who is an Ironman Triathlete and still rocking out (at the age of fifty-two) on world tours as the frontman for his legendary band the Cro-Mags. Joseph&#x2019;s passion for educating the world about the benefits of a plant-based diet comes through on each page, in a voice and a vocabulary that is uniquely his own. At the end of the day, he wants readers to live a long, healthy, happy life . . . and he won&#x2019;t take no for an answer.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Think eating meat makes you macho?

With the help of friends and colleagues (Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Carl Reiner, Neil Simon and Larry Gelbart) , Caesar developed original television comedy that rocketed him to stardom in &#34;Your Show of Shows&#34; and &#34;Caesars Hour&#34;. This group&#39;s hilarious rap-and-write sessions, many of which are re-created here, produced Caesars famous Professor shtick, the unforgettable Swiss-clock routine, the engaging series of duo performances with Imogene Coca, and many other rib-tickling scenarios. These were the &#34;Glory Years.&#34; But when &#34;Caesars Hour&#34; ended in 1958, the nightmare suddenly began. The combination of devastating insecurity and the pressure ofsuccess led to a dependence on alcohol and pills that soon became an addiction. Periods of despair alternated with uncontrollable rages and violent behavior; work was sporadic and his family relationships were under tremendous strain. His wife,Florence, rode the roller coaster of depression and manic behavior with him, hoping and believing that it would change. Change did come at rock bottom. When, in 1978, an attempt to revive his act with Imogene Coca fell through, the drinking increased and Sid fled to Canada. A meeting with the right doctor helped him to confront his disease, and a sustained effort to rebuild body and mind began. Previous attempts at classical psychoanalysis had failed, but alone in a Paris hotel room, Caesar developed a unique method of self-analysis to reassemble his being. By the time of publication Caesar was in total possession of a dynamic self and engaged in exciting new work. This story lays bare the traumatic ups and downs of one of the best in show business. Studded with anecdotes from those who knew him best, it entertains, inspires, and reveals the true Caesar to all his fans.</p><p></p><h2>Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie: The Oregon Trail Diary of Hattie Campbell, 1847 (Dear America Series)</h2><p>Thirteen-year-old Hattie Campbell records the details of her family&#39;s harrowing migration to Oregon in a covered wagon and describes the many challenges, both joyful and tragic, that mark the journey.</p><p>Grade 3-7&#x2013;Hattie Campbell is 13 years old in 1847 when her parents decide to sell their farm in Missouri and make their way across the Oregon Trail to Oregon City for a fresh start after the death of Hatties sisters in this title by Kristiana Gregory (Scholastic, 1997). She is given a journal for her birthday and told to record both the bad and the good, Hattie. And so she does. Teaming up with dozens of other families, the wagon train begins its six-month journey across the prairies and mountains of the West. Their wagons are full and their hearts are hopeful. Hattie reflects upon the slowly changing scenery, the curiously friendly Indians they meet, and the devastating toll the long journey takes. Many in the wagon train arrive in Oregon City on foot with only a few precious possessions. Black-and-white photos, a recipe for Johnny Cake, and maps of the route can be found at the end of the book. The narration is well done, and Hatties youthful voice shines through. While the plot is not riveting, young girls will enjoy Hatties journey and elementary grade social studies classes studying the Oregon Trail will learn about life on the Trail.&#x2013;<i>Tricia Melgaard, Centennial Middle School, Broken Arrow, OK</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.In a work subtitled ``The Oregon Trail Diary of Hattie Campbell,'' Gregory (Earthquake at Dawn, 1992, etc.) reconvenes the Dear America series in 1847, as Hattie, her parents, and her two younger brothers begin the long trek from Missouri to Oregon by wagon train. At first the adventure is exciting, but as the days, weeks, and months pass, Hattie realizes what a dangerous and tedious trip it will be. They cross the prairies, hastening the journey as news of the fate of the Donner party reaches them, but death, disease, weather, and the terrain take a terrible toll. The Campbells lose neighbors and friends until they almost believe they cannot bear to continue. Continue they do: Eight months after they set out, the remaining wagons arrive in Oregon City, just in time for Christmas. Through Hattie's diary, Gregory brings the rigors of the trip to life, but she also includes the details that kept the settlers going--the friendships and camaraderie that developed and the joyful events (a wedding and some births) that occurred. Gregory brings a sobering dose of reality to an era that's often romanticized; this is a fine glimpse of history on a human scale.

The SN had steep grades, a tunnel, picnic grounds in a redwood grove, long trestles, bridges, a ferryboat that carried an entire train across a freshwater bay, and a spectacular ride over the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. &#34;Passenger trains of the SN were a technological wonder of the day and operated on three voltages, using trolley poles, pantographs and third-rail shoes. Automatic cab signals guided the green interurban trains over the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. &#34;From its earliest days, the SN also was a major freight carrier, using electric-powered equipment. Late at night, when passenger trains did not operate, electric freight motors hauled the agricultural products of the Sacramento Valley and the output of Bay Area factories. &#34;Like most intercity electric railways, the SN was built by local capitalists involved in other enterprises; in this case, men who had sought riches in the reclamation projects and bountiful harvests of the Sacramento Valley, and the development of hydroelectric power. &#34;Included here are more than 470 rare photographs, many ofthem published for the first time, as well as detailed chapters on the history, finance, rolling stock, signals, power systems and terminals. Timetables, financial and traffic data, scale drawings of rolling stock, and tickets are also included and, in one chapter, the reader takes a ride on the Sacramento Northern in the mid-1930s. Maps were drawn especially by Seattle cartographer Wayne Hom, with an endsheet map by John Signor. Altogether, this is a rich and rewarding account of railroad history and operation.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Health Information Management: Concepts, Principles and Practice</h2><p>Health Information Management: Concepts, Principles, and Practice is the most widely used textbook in health information management baccalaureate programs in the country.

[Mooallem] seamlessly blends reportage from the front lines of wildlife conservation with a lively cultural history of animals in America... This is not a book about wilderness; it&#x2019;s a book about us." --<i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>Journalist Jon Mooallem has watched his little daughter&#x2019;s world overflow with animals butterfly pajamas, appliqu�d owls&#x2014;while the actual world she&#x2019;s inheriting slides into a great storm of extinction. Half of all species could disappear by the end of the century, and scientists now concede that most of America&#x2019;s endangered animals will survive only if conservationists keep rigging the world around them in their favor. So Mooallem ventures into the field, often taking his daughter with him, to move beyond childlike fascination and make those creatures feel more real. <i>Wild Ones</i> is a tour through our environmental moment and the eccentric cultural history of people and wild animals in America that inflects it&#x2014;from Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s celebrations of early abundance to the turn-of the-last-century origins of the teddy bear to the whale-loving hippies of the 1970s. In America, <i>Wild Ones</i> discovers, wildlife has always inhabited the terrain of our imagination as much as the actual land.<br><br>The journey is framed by the stories of three modern-day endangered species: the polar bear, victimized by climate change and ogled by tourists outside a remote northern town; the little-known Lange&#x2019;s metalmark butterfly, foundering on a shred of industrialized land near San Francisco; and the whooping crane as it&#x2019;s led on a months-long migration by costumed men in ultralight airplanes. The wilderness that <i>Wild Ones</i> navigates is a scrappy, disorderly place where amateur conservationists do grueling, sometimes preposterous-looking work; where a marketer maneuvers to control the polar bear&#x2019;s image while Martha Stewart turns up to film those beasts for her show on the Hallmark Channel. Our most comforting ideas about nature unravel. In their place, Mooallem forges a new and affirming vision of the human animal and the wild ones as kindred creatures on an imperfect planet.<br><br>With propulsive curiosity and searing wit, and without the easy moralizing and nature worship of environmental journalism&#x2019;s older guard, <i>Wild Ones</i> merges reportage, science, and history into a humane and endearing meditation on what it means to live in, and bring a life into, a broken world.<br><br><b>--And don&#x2019;t miss the album based on the book: WILD ONES by Black Prairie--</b></p><p>JON MOOALLEM has been a contributing writer to <i>The New York Times Magazine </i>since 2006 and is a writer at large for <i>Pop-Up Magazine</i>, the live magazine in San Francisco.

He and his family live in San Francisco.<br><br><b>www.JonMooallem.com</b>During the Cold War, a joint U.S.-Canadian military installation was built outside the tiny northern town of Churchill, Manitoba, at the western edge of Hudson Bay. Those stationed at Fort Churchill had several jobs to do, like be ready to repulse the Soviets if they invaded over the North Pole and figure out how to lob nuclear warheads at Moscow through the Aurora Borealis, which was proving, mysteriously, to muck up the guidance systems on their rockets. A lot of the soldiers&#x2019; time was also spent dealing with a nuisance: hundreds of polar bears that ambled across the tundra there every fall.<br><p>In November 1958, for example, one ate a pair of boots at the firing range. Another smashed a building&#x2019;s window, poked his head in, and had to be blasted with a fire extinguisher. At least twenty polar bears were loitering near the mess hall and the dump, and, late one Sunday night, three turned up at the central commissary. Soldiers in station wagons drove them back into the wilderness. One report noted, &#x201c;The most effective, anti-dawdling weapon has been the small helicopter.&#x201d; Even so, occasionally the bears would rear up on their hind legs and try to tussle with the armored flying machines. One helicopter pilot described how unsettling it was to make a low pass and find &#x201c;some six feet of indignant polar bear throwing haymakers&#x201d; with paws the size of dinner plates. After a while, military contractors limited the amount of work done outside at night; the higher-ups decided it would just be easier to stay out of the polar bears&#x2019; way. &#x201c;So this is civilization,&#x201d; began one newspaper article about military wives at Fort Churchill.</p><p>By the time I arrived, one November a half-century later, the military was gone. The fort had been dismantled and carted off, though two massive, ruined radar domes still sat in the distance like some post-apocalyptic Epcot attraction. A dozen specially built vehicles called Tundra Buggies crawled along the network of dirt roads the military had built and abandoned. Each was stuffed with tourists, many of whom had paid several thousand dollars a head to fly to Churchill, now billing itself as &#x201c;The Polar Bear Capital of the World.&#x201d; They were mostly older vacationers, taken out to the tundra every day to get a glimpse of the animals, then deposited back in town to prowl the gift shops along Churchill&#x2019;s main road, buying polar bear caps and snow hats, polar bear T-shirts, polar bear aprons, polar bear Christmas ornaments, polar bear magnets, polar bear boxer shorts, polar bear light-switch plates, polar bear wind chimes, polar bear baby bibs, and pajamas that say &#x201c;Bearly Awake.&#x201d;</p><p>A Tundra Buggy, if it resembles anything at all, resembles a double-wide school bus propped up on monster-truck tires. Three had pulled off the road to watch a lone polar bear splayed flat at the rim of a frozen pond, asleep in the willows. I was behind them in a scaled-down vehicle known as Buggy One, one of the storied, original rigs of the fleet. Buggy One is now operated by a conservation group, Polar Bears International. One of the group&#x2019;s videographers was shooting footage of the bear through an open window while the other staff on board tried to sit perfectly still so as not to rattle his tripod. The cameraman had been filming the bear for a long time, in Super HD, hoping it would stand up or do something alluring. Up ahead, tourists filed onto the rear decks of their buggies, training their Telephoto lenses and little point-and-shoots at the animal. It lifted its head once or twice, but that was it. After a couple of minutes, I noticed that the tourists had turned ninety degrees and were photographing us, aboard Buggy One, instead.</p><p>It was then that Martha Stewart&#x2019;s helicopter came into view. Everyone turned to watch it as it passed, flying low and very far ahead. Two hundred years ago, Arctic explorers described polar bears leaping out of the water and into boats, trying to &#x201c;resolutely seize and devour&#x201d; whichever dog or human being was sitting closest to their jaws, unprovoked and absolutely undeterred even if you tried to set the bear on fire. Now Martha Stewart had come to Churchill to shoot a special segment about the bears for her daytime television show on the Hallmark Channel.</p><p>Polar Bears International had been working in a loose partnership with Martha Stewart for many months in advance to handle logistics for her shoot. The group was trying to ensure that Martha told the right story about the animals. It isn&#x2019;t enough anymore to gush about how magnificent or cute polar bears are, as the many travel writers and television personalities that came to Churchill over the years had tended to. The stakes were too high now&#x2014;too urgent. Climate change had put the bear in severe jeopardy. According to a 2007 study by U.S. government scientists, two-thirds of the world&#x2019;s polar bears are likely to be gone by the middle of this century. And, of course, that&#x2019;s only one of many dispiriting prognoses trickling into the news these days. Another study predicts that climate change may wipe out one of every ten plant and animal species on the planet during that same time. Another claims seven of every ten could be gone. Tropical birds, butterflies, flying squirrels, coral reefs, koalas&#x2014;the new reality will rip away at all of them, and more. The projections range from bona fide tragedies to more niggling but genuinely disruptive bummers: tens of millions of people in Bangladesh are likely to be displaced by sea-level rise and flooding; the Forest Service warns of maple syrup shortages in America.</p><p>The polar bear, in other words, is an early indicator of all this other turmoil coming our way. It is, as everyone on Buggy One kept telling me, a &#x201c;canary in the coal mine&#x201d;&#x2014;that was the phrase they used, always, with unrelenting discipline. The animal had become a symbol for some otherwise inexpressible pang&#x2014;of guilt, of panic&#x2014;that can burble into the back of your mind, or the pit of your stomach, when you think about the future of life on Earth. But, Polar Bears International was arguing, it could also be a mascot&#x2014;a rallying point. By now, bears are all but guaranteed to disappear from a lot of their range. But the science suggests that there&#x2019;s still time to slow climate change down and, in the long term, keep the species&#x2014;and many others along with it&#x2014;from vanishing entirely.</p><p>Practically speaking, this leaves conservationists like Polar Bears International in a unique and sometimes disorienting position. Unlike with other species, the central threat to polar bears isn&#x2019;t something that can be tackled or solved on the ground, out in the immediate ecosystem. The only meaningful way to save the polar bear now is to influence the energy policies and behavior of people who live thousands of miles away&#x2014;which means, in part, influencing influential media personalities like Martha Stewart. At some point, polar bear conservation stopped being solely the work of scientists and became the work of lawyers, lobbyists, and celebrities as well. The bear is dependent on the stories we tell about it.</p><p>After spending the fall in Churchill, Polar Bears International&#x2019;s president, Robert Buchanan, would head back home to the United States and start traveling from city to city, hosting talks by scientists and zookeepers, trying to use the appeal of this one charismatic animal to inspire people to reduce their own carbon footprints, however slightly&#x2014;to drive less, to buy recycled goods. In Kansas City, PBI had partnered with the hardware chain Lowe&#x2019;s to get inner-city kids to weatherize their neighbors&#x2019; homes, saving energy for heating and cooling. In suburban Connecticut, they&#x2019;d cosponsored &#x201c;Polar Bear Empathy Day,&#x201d; at which members of the local Polar Bear Club, in a reversal of their traditional cold-water swims, put on heavy parkas and stood on a scorching beach in July to show solidarity with the bears in an overheating Arctic. All together, Robert regarded these strategies and stunts as a kind of psychological guerrilla warfare. &#x201c;Polar bears are in serious friggin&#x2019; trouble,&#x201d; he told me that morning on Buggy One. &#x201c;But until you change the consumer&#x2019;s attitude, you&#x2019;re not going to change the policy or the political will.&#x201d; By &#x201c;consumer,&#x201d; he presumably meant &#x201c;citizen.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a marketing gambit, after all. And Robert, a big man who talks in a languorous growl, felt very comfortable relating to it in those terms. This was his retirement. In his thirty-five-year career, he&#x2019;d risen to marketing director at Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, overseeing beverage and alcohol brands during the heyday of the corporation, when it owned Universal Studios and a large share of the music industry and was producing flashy wine-cooler commercials starring a young Bruce Willis. Robert handled cognacs and whiskey and Tropicana orange juice. &#x201c;I take products to market,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a marketer.&#x201d; Now he&#x2019;d put himself on the polar bear account.</p><p>Robert was literally trying to control the image of the polar bear in Churchill before that image was broadcast around the world. Churchill turns out to be the best, most convenient place in the world to see or film polar bears in the wild. (When you see a wild polar bear on TV or the Internet, the chances are good that you&#x2019;re looking at a Churchill bear.) Because Polar Bears International operates in close partnership with a tour company in Churchill that owns the majority of the permits and vehicles needed to access the animals on the tundra, the group has been able to intercept most of the major media that come through town. They install biologists and climatologists on the reporters&#x2019; buggies like scientific press agents, trying to make sure an accurate narrative comes across, and they provide B-roll footage of bears plunging into melting slush to help newscasters illustrate the problem. In past years, though, PBI had gone out of its way to help television crews only to feel betrayed by the finished product: the reporters ignore climate change altogether, or regurgitate the junk theories of climate change deniers. Most television crews are now asked to sign memorandums of understanding, outlining certain guidelines, before working with PBI. (As a rule, one PBI staffer told me, Robert regards all journalists as &#x201c;pirates and thieves.&#x201d;) But that fall, Martha Stewart hadn&#x2019;t signed one. And in the days before her arrival, her producers had become a little incommunicative about their plans. We&#x2019;d all headed out on Buggy One that morning because PBI had hoped to tour the tundra alongside Martha and her crew, docking back-to-back with Martha&#x2019;s buggy to pass people back and forth periodically for interviews. But that was starting to feel unlikely now. Though no one was quite saying it, there seemed to be concern that Martha Stewart was going rogue.</p><p>Everyone on Buggy One sat around for quite a while, not speaking much, while the cameraman stayed locked optimistically on the bear lumped in the mud outside, trying to gather whatever stock footage he could. Eventually, the polar bear got up and walked away. The cameraman shrugged.</p><p>We drove on. We looked for more bears. People noodled on their laptops and iPads. It felt aimless. Then, sometime after lunch, a voice crackled over the radio. It sounded like we would finally rendezvous with the Martha Stewart people and do a little filming on Buggy One. A PBI employee started wiping down the vehicle&#x2019;s counters with wet wipes. She hung everyone&#x2019;s parkas on coat hooks in the back. But when we got closer, we saw Martha&#x2019;s buggy receding in our windshield, fairly rapidly. &#x201c;Oh, they&#x2019;re moving now,&#x201d; our driver groaned.</p><p>All day, a strange paparazzi-like triangle had been materializing: Martha wanted good access to polar bears, and PBI wanted good access to Martha. I wanted to watch the whole process of brokering access, since I was quickly understanding that the media relations dimension of polar bear conservation was a critical part&#x2014;maybe the most critical part&#x2014;of the preservation of this five-million-year-old species.</p><p>Our driver pushed Buggy One as fast as it would go, which wasn&#x2019;t very fast, trying to gain ground. Something that I&#x2019;d kind of suspected for hours was suddenly obvious: we were chasing Martha Stewart across the tundra.</p></p><h2>The Abrahamic Revolution: God&#39;s Mission in Motion</h2><p>God set His mission into motion when He invited Abraham to lay down his plans for a greater plan a global plan.

Karen Marie Moning is destined to make her mark on the genre."<br>--<i>Romantic Times</i></p><h2>Galileo, Bellarmine, and the Bible</h2><p>Considered the paradigm case of the troubled interaction between science and religion, the conflict between Galileo and the Church continues to generate new research and lively debate. Richard J. Blackwell offers a fresh approach to the Galileo case, using as his primary focus the biblical and ecclesiastical issues that were the battleground for the celebrated confrontation. Blackwell's research in the Vatican manuscript collection and the Jesuit archives in Rome enables him to re-create a vivid picture of the trends and counter-trends that influenced leading Catholic thinkers of the period: the conservative reaction to the Reformation, the role of authority in biblical exegesis and in guarding orthodoxy from the inroads of "unbridled spirits," and the position taken by Cardinal Bellarmine and the Jesuits in attempting to weigh the discoveries of the new science in the context of traditional philosophy and theology. A centerpiece of Blackwell's investigation is his careful reading of the brief treatise <i>Letter on the Motion of the Earth</i> by Paolo Antonio Foscarini, a Carmelite scholar, arguing for the compatibility of the Copernican system with the Bible. Blackwell appends the first modern translation into English of this important and neglected document, which was placed on the Index of Forbidden Books in 1616. Though there were differing and competing theories of biblical interpretation advocated in Galileo's time&#x2015;the legacy of the Council of Trent, the views of Cardinal Bellarmine, the most influential churchman of his time, and, finally, the claims of authority and obedience that weakened the abillity of Jesuit scientists to support the new science&#x2015;all contributed to the eventual condemnation of Galileo in 1633. Blackwell argues convincingly that the maintenance of ecclesiastical authority, not the scientific issues themselves, led to that tragic trial.</p><p>Richard J.

In this absorbing memoir of life in the Wyoming high country, Mary Budd Flitner offers a more authentic glimpse into the daily realities of ranch life&#x2014;and what it takes to survive in the ranching world.<br><br> Some of Flitner&#x2019;s recollections are humorous and lighthearted. Others take a darker turn. A modern-day rancher with decades of experience, Mary has dealt with the hardships and challenges that come with this way of life. She&#x2019;s survived harsh conditions like the &#x201c;winter of 50 below&#x201d; and economic downturns that threatened her family&#x2019;s livelihood. She&#x2019;s also wrestled with her role as a woman in a profession that doesn&#x2019;t always treat her as equal. But for all its challenges, Flitner has also savored ranching&#x2019;s joys, including the ties that bind multiple generations of families to the land.<br><br><i>My Ranch, Too </i>begins with the story of her great-grandfather, Daniel Budd, who in 1878 drove a herd of cattle into Wyoming Territory and settled his family in an area where conditions seemed favorable. Four generations later, Mary grew up on this same portion of land, learning how to ride horseback and take care of livestock. When she married Stan, she simply moved from one ranch to another, joining the Flitner family&#x2019;s Diamond Tail Ranch in Wyoming&#x2019;s Big Horn Basin.<br><br> The Diamond Tail is not Mary&#x2019;s alone to run, as she is quick to acknowledge. Everybody pitches in, even the smallest of children. But when Mary takes the responsibility of gathering a herd of cattle or makes solo rounds at the crack of dawn to check on the livestock, we have no doubt that this is indeed her ranch, too.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Mary Budd Flitner</b> has been a prominent rancher in Wyoming for more than fifty years.

During a twenty-five-year career he has specialized in history and biography, most notably as editorial director and contributor to the &#34;Dictionary of American Biography&#34; and the &#34;Dictionary of American History&#34;. He divides his time between North Carolina and New York.Close on the heels of John Hoyt Williams's Sam Houston (1992), freelance historian De Bruhl's biography of the colorful Texas hero also commemorates the 200th anniversary of Houston's birth--but this is a lackluster, inferior chronicle. All of the historical details are present in De Bruhl's account, but the overall sense of the man behind the legend is incomplete. Houston's Virginia origins and early adult years as a battle-scarred Indian fighter and Tennessee politician are dutifully recorded, as is the marital crisis that sent his political career into a tailspin, driving him westward in 1830 to live in drunken despair with his Cherokee friends. Seeing a golden opportunity to start fresh in the influx of American settlers into the Mexican territory soon to become Texas, Houston thrived on the heady expansionist sentiments filling the air, taking charge as the commander of a volunteer army when friction between the newcomers and Mexico turned to war. Successful in a decisive engagement against Santa Anna's army, Houston quickly became the preeminent statesman of the fledgling Republic of Texas, but his staunch pro- Union position after statehood was achieved left him increasingly isolated and eventually cost him his Senate seat, derailed his presidential aspirations, and caused his precipitous removal as governor when he refused to support secession. Houston died in disgrace in 1863. Substantive but uninspired, and marred by editorializing (a woman protecting her property from appropriation by Houston during the war with Mexico is labeled ``an unpatriotic virago'').

BUSH, LACROSSE, WISCONSIN, 18 OCTOBER, 2000<br>&nbsp;<br>Old Mel hired one of Da&#x2019;s nephews&#x2014;the slow-witted one with the dent in his forehead&#x2014;to sink a well in his back acre. The irrigation trenches his family had dug between the rows of oil palms didn&#x2019;t extend to the rear fence and the new fronds were browning even before they fanned open. It hadn&#x2019;t rained for a month. Mel had been lugging watering cans out there for two weeks and his back bones were starting to clack like mah-jong tiles. So, a well, a cheap Chinese pump, half a dozen sprinklers, and all he&#x2019;d need to do was flick a switch. Oil palms took care of themselves if you watered them often and gave them manure treats once every three months. Twenty palms saved without crippling his spine. Cheap at twice the price.<br>So, on Saturday last, Old Mel sat on the top rung of the back fence and watched the young man work. The nephew&#x2019;s skull indentation made Mel wonder if he&#x2019;d been hit by a metal petanque ball thrown at high speed. Such was the concavity. But he decided it was better not to ask. He knew the response would be long and slobbered. He knew the nephew would stop work to reply because he couldn&#x2019;t perform two functions simultaneously. So Mel merely sat and watched him dig. He could have chipped in with some labor to make the job easier but Old Mel was a firm believer in not hiring a goat and bleating himself.<br>The tried-and-tested southern Thai method of sinking a well would undoubtedly not have been acceptable in any Western country where concepts such as &#x201c;quality&#x201d; and &#x201c;safety standards&#x201d; were firmly in place. Four one-meter concrete pipe segments lay on the ground to one side. The nephew would dig a hole broad and deep enough to insert one of the segments. He would then jump into the hole and continue to burrow downward, scooping out earth from beneath the concrete pipe. The latter would sink into the ground like a very slow elevator. Once its top lip was level with the surface of the field, the second pipe segment would be placed on top of it and the excavation would continue. The earth in Old Mel&#x2019;s field was a mixture of dirt and sand and once you got below the knotty pissweed, it was not terribly hard to dig. The problems would begin&#x2014;if you were lucky&#x2014;when the third section was inserted and the water started to rise, turning the hole into a mudbath spa. Before the fourth segment was level with the ground, the unfortunate young man could be spending half his time submerged in murky brown water.<br>But on this arid Saturday morning the well would not allow itself to be sunk. At no more than waist depth below the surface, the nephew&#x2019;s hoe clanged against something solid. A loud metallic gong scattered the wimpy drongos from the trees. Lizards scampered from beneath rocks. The nephew was obviously enchanted by the percussion because he struck three more times before Mel could convince him to cease. The old man climbed down from his perch, hooked his toes into his sandals, and ambled over to the hole. He stopped at the concrete rim and stared down at his laborer&#x2019;s feet which, against all the odds, stood astride a small island of rust.<br>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be much,&#x201d; Mel said. &#x201c;Probably a barrel lid. Sink your hoe off to the edges. You can work your way below it and pry it up.&#x201d;<br>Easily said. The nephew prodded and poked but every foray produced the same tinny clunk. There was no way around it. For all anyone knew, the obstruction might have extended from the Gulf all the way across to the Andaman Sea and been connected to one of the earth&#x2019;s plates. All Mel could think about was that this sheet of metal stood defiantly between him and lower-back-pain relief. He wasn&#x2019;t about to give in without a fight whether it unbalanced the earth or not. He walked to the fence, grabbed a solid black crowbar and held it out to the lad.<br>&#x201c;Here, use this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Smash your way through it.&#x201d;<br>Da&#x2019;s nephew stared forlornly at the tool. It was obvious some laborious mechanical process was taking place in his mind. The crowbar was getting heavy in Mel&#x2019;s hand.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just paid for digging,&#x201d; said the nephew, at last. &#x201c;Nobody said nothing about smashing. That&#x2019;s a job for specialists, smashing is. I&#x2019;m just a digger.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Go on, boy. Look at it. It&#x2019;s rusted to hell. You could sneeze a hole in it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Old Mel. Wear and tear on the tools. All that added time...&#x201d;<br>This was a lesson learned for Mel. A brain dent did not necessarily affect a young man&#x2019;s ability to extort.<br>&#x201c;All right, look. I&#x2019;m not going to pay you to start a new well somewhere else, so why don&#x2019;t we just say&nbsp;... what? Fifty&nbsp;<i>baht</i>&nbsp;extra? How&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br>There was no further discussion. The nephew began jabbing the crowbar into the metal plate with renewed enthusiasm. With the fifty&nbsp;<i>baht</i>&nbsp;incentive, the young man performed like a large, enthusiastic can opener. He stood at the center of the hole and gouged through the metal around him. Like Mel, he&#x2019;d probably expected to be able to lift out a perfect circle of rusted metal and continue his dig south uninterrupted. He would have anticipated a firm grounding of earth beneath the metal. He probably didn&#x2019;t expect in his wildest and most troubling dreams to hear that teeth-grinding creak, or to have the metal upon which he stood drop like a theatrical trapdoor. He seemed to hover in midair for a split second before plummeting into the dark void beneath him.<br>The silence that followed stretched into the hot early morning like warm noodle dough. Crickets and songbirds held their breaths. A solitary wispy cloud hung overhead. Mel stood leaning forward slightly to look into the hole but all he could see was blackness. He didn&#x2019;t recall the lad&#x2019;s name so he couldn&#x2019;t call it out.<br>&#x201c;You all right there?&#x201d; he said. Then, realizing the newly opened shaft might be vastly deep he shouted the same question. &#x201c;YOU ALL RIGHT?&#x201d;<br>There was no reply.<br>A number of lands around the globe have what they refer to as a southern temperament. Thailand is no exception. Old Mel could surely have gone running off screaming for help. He might have beaten a pestle against the old tin tub that hung from his balcony or trekked those two kilometers to the nearest payphone. But he was a southerner. He broke off a stem of sweet grass to chew while he sat on the concrete segment and gazed into the abyss. There was a good deal to consider. Perhaps this had been a blessing in disguise. He wondered whether they&#x2019;d chanced on an old well shaft. Saved themselves time. But there&#x2019;d been no splash. It was probably dry. Bad luck, that.<br>&#x201c;Young fellow?&#x201d; he called again, half-heartedly.<br>There was still no response.<br>Mel wondered just how long was a suitable period of time before he should get anxious. He was in the middle of a plan. Go back to the shed. Get a rope. Tie it to the fence. Lower it into the hole, and&nbsp;... but there was his back problem. That wouldn&#x2019;t work. He&#x2019;d have to call his neighbor, Gai, to&#x2014;<br>&#x201c;Old Mel.&#x201d;<br>The voice was odd, echoey, like that of a lone sardine in a tin can.<br>&#x201c;Old Mel. You there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What are you playing at down there?&#x201d; Mel asked. &#x201c;You stuck?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, no. I had the wind knocked out of me, that&#x2019;s all, but I chanced lucky. I&#x2019;m on&nbsp;... a bed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they call concussion, boy. You need a&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m on a bed. Really I am.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What makes you think so?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can feel the springs.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Plant roots, boy. Easily mistaken for bedsprings.&#x201d;<br>Mel realized that in the nephew&#x2019;s case, concussion wouldn&#x2019;t have made a lot of difference.<br>&#x201c;All right, look, I need to fetch somebody,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;You know, I can probably get myself out, Old Mel. I&#x2019;m not so far from the hole. I&#x2019;m looking up at it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You injured?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, but my shirt&#x2019;s snagged on one of the springs. You should come down and have a look. This is odd, Old Mel. The more my eyes get used to the dark, the odder it is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What can you see, boy?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Windows.&#x201d;<br>Old Mel chuckled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re on a bed and you&#x2019;ve got windows round you? Sounds to me like you&#x2019;ve found yourself an underground bedroom. What are the odds of that?&#x201d;<br>He was wondering where the nearest psychiatric care unit might be. Whether analysis was included under the government thirty-<i>baht</i>&nbsp;universal health initiative.<br>&#x201c;And there&#x2019;s...&#x201d; the nephew began.<br>&#x201c;A bedside lamp?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, no. Old Mel. Old Mel.&#x201d;<br>There was a real panicky timbre to his voice.<br>&#x201c;What? What is it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s skeletons down here.&#x201d;<br>Mel was hoping he wouldn&#x2019;t have to be responsible in some way for the young fellow&#x2019;s rehabilitation. Whether he&#x2019;d be obliged to employ him in some menial position in which his affliction wouldn&#x2019;t be too much of a disadvantage. Scarecrow, perhaps? Maybe he could find a witness who&#x2019;d swear the boy was already eight points brain-dead before he fell down the old well shaft. You had to be careful these days with so many unemployed lawyers around. Mean buggers, those lawyers.<br>&#x201c;They animal bones, boy?&#x201d; he asked, just to humor the lad.<br>&#x201c;No, Old Mel. They&#x2019;re people all right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How can you tell?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;One&#x2019;s wearing a hat.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>That was as far as I managed to get with the fertile prose version. It takes it out of you, writing with heart. And it was just for me really. Sort of a confirmation to myself that my inner diva can still make love to the keyboard when she&#x2019;s in the mood. I have to keep her roped and gagged when I&#x2019;m writing for the newspapers. They don&#x2019;t like her at all. They don&#x2019;t want love. They want a quick tryst in a motel room that&#x2019;s forgotten in a few hours. They want dates and times and figures and facts and stats. They want the names and ages of the victims and the perpetrators, the ranks of every police officer vaguely involved with the case, the verbatim quotes from experts, and the ungrammatical misinformation from eyewitnesses. They don&#x2019;t care what I think. I&#x2019;m just that peculiar woman on the crime desk or, at least, I used to be. I&#x2019;d try to sneak in the odd metaphor from time to time but the&nbsp;<i>Mail</i>&nbsp;would set their editorial medusa on me until my piece looked like a lexicon of criminal terminology and place names. This is what hit the newspaper shops on Sunday morning.<br>TWO DEAD BODIES IN BURIED VEHICLE<br>Chumphon province.&nbsp;Two unidentified bodies were found yesterday in a Volkswagen Kombi Type 2 camper van, registration number Or Por 243, from Surat Thani province, buried at the rear of a palm oil plantation in Bang Ka sub-district, Lang Suan district, Chumphon province. Police Major General Suvit Pamaluang of the Lang Suan municipality announced that the bodies were discovered at 0800 hours on the morning of Saturday 23 August by Mr. Mel Phumihan, the owner of the land. So far, the victims have not been identified and there have been no clues found as to how the vehicle became buried there.<br>At 1000 hours, constable Ma Yai and constable Ma Lek from the Pak Nam sub-regional municipality police station in Lang Suan sub-district were dispatched to Bang Ka following a call logged at 0923 hours. Upon their arrival at Mr. Mel&#x2019;s palm plantation they were met by Mr. Mel (68 years old) and his day laborer, Mr. Anuphong Wiset (22). The two men had been digging a well and had encountered an unexpected obstacle beneath the ground in the form of a complete 1972 model Volkswagen Camper van popularly known in the West as a Kombi with traces of red and cream trimming. The description of the vehicle was wired to the Surat police station and officers are still attempting to trace any missing vehicles answering this description. Desk Sergeant Monluk Pradibat at the central motor registry in Bangkok informed this newspaper that, &#x201c;This vehicle will be particularly difficult to trace as computer records of missing vehicles date back only as far as 1994. Any records before that would be filed on paper forms at our central warehouse.&#x201d;<br>As to the identity of the bodies, Police Major Mana Sachawacharapong, the head of the Pak Nam police station, in whose jurisdiction the discovery was made, told our reporter, &#x201c;The identities of the dead bodies and the causes of death are still being investigated. But I can tell you that this was either an accident, murder or an act of nature.&#x201d; The captain was not, however, prepared to rule out suicide.<br>They always did that, Thai police. Cover all the bases. Shot four times in the face over a period of twenty minutes? Don&#x2019;t rule out suicide. They&#x2019;d recently found a head in a plastic bag suspended on a rope from a bridge in Bangkok and they hadn&#x2019;t dismissed the possibility of suicide. It gave those self-promoting senior policemen something to talk about to the press. Made them sound more important. Rather than admit &#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t got the foggiest idea,&#x201d; the ranking officer of the day would go down the list of bloody obvious possibilities even if he hadn&#x2019;t visited the site of the crime. As long as you spelled his name correctly he&#x2019;d talk to you the whole day. Perhaps you can see I have a certain dark feeling toward our gentlemen in khaki.<br>But the good news is, I was back. All right, I didn&#x2019;t get a by-line, the Thai dailies don&#x2019;t encourage reporter egoism, but word would get out that I&#x2019;d risen from the dead. I might be living in the buttock end of the world but I could still sniff out a story. After nine months of highway traffic pile-up reports and coconut yield statistics, I&#x2019;d been thrilled when I heard they&#x2019;d discovered the bodies. Please let them be murder victims, I prayed. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I&#x2019;m not a bloodthirsty person. I just needed reassuring that man hadn&#x2019;t stopped displaying inhumanity to man. I&#x2019;d begun to doubt it.<br>I&#x2019;d been sitting in one of our grass-roofed huts overlooking the bay, gutting mackerel when I heard the news of old Mel&#x2019;s VW. Unless we get a few sea bass or a tasty anchovy, mackerel gutting&#x2019;s usually the highlight of the week in our cul-de-sac of a village. Kow, the squid-boat captain, stopped by on his Honda Dream with its fishball-dispensing sidecar. He&#x2019;s our local Paul Revere. You don&#x2019;t need a cell phone or Internet connection if you have someone like Captain Kow in the vicinity. I&#x2019;ve no idea how he hears it all but I&#x2019;d wager he&#x2019;s a good hour ahead of the BBC on most news.<br>&#x201c;You hear?&#x201d; he yelled. Of course I hadn&#x2019;t heard. I never hear anything. &#x201c;They found a car with dead bodies in it under Old Mel&#x2019;s back lot.&#x201d;<br>He smiled. He&#x2019;s got a sort of mail slot where his front teeth ought to be. It makes you want to doubt him but he&#x2019;s invariably right. His southern accent&#x2019;s so thick I needed a few seconds to decipher his words.<br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Old Mel?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;Got twenty hectares out off the Bang Ka road just before Bang Ga.&#x201d;<br>I was elated. This was the first burst of excitement I&#x2019;d felt all year. I had to get over there. My little brother, Arnon, playfully known as Arny, was out somewhere with the truck and Granddad Jah had the motorcycle. I didn&#x2019;t have any choice but to use Mair&#x2019;s old auntie bicycle with the metal basket on the front. I shouted to my mother that I was taking it and heard a faint &#x201c;Make sure you put petrol in it&#x201d; from deep inside our shop. Right, Mair.<br>Apart from the bridge over the Lang Suan river the roads are mostly flat around here, all palm and coconut plantations. Pleasant enough if you like green&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t.

The verse takes on the familiar structure, "Here is the parrot that stretched/and squawked/that woke up the tiger that/growled and stalked/that woke up the lion/starting to roar-." Arnold's detailed illustrations add dimension and interest to the story, from his image of a large alarm clock striking five as the parrot jolts up in bed to the lion growling at the table while eating fried eggs and spilling coffee. The silliness of the plot is reinforced with the popping bug eyes of all the animals that end the tale by lounging in the various zoo habitats.

The book substitutes a jovial little picture of an animal for each bracketed word, making this a rebus and offering playful practice for children who can't quite read yet. Here's the unspoken premise that emerges in the illustrations: the zoo animals sleep each night in their apartments in the city. It's five in the morning when they begin to wake up one another. One by one, they climb aboard a city bus and ride to their day jobs. They disembark and trundle off to their areas, where they look as sleepy as zoo critters often do. Now we know why! Arnold's playful line-and-wash drawings, textured with his signature squiggles, will amuse children on every page. Even parents will smile at the bus-riding chicken absorbed in reading the <i>Stock Market News</i>. Good fun. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She turned to writing in order to supplement the family income and had many short stories published in magazines and newspapers. Then, in 1862, during the height of the American Civil War, Louisa went to Georgetown to work as a nurse, but she contracted typhoid. Out of her experiences she wrote Hospital Sketches (1864) which won wide acclaim, followed by an adult novel, Moods. She was reluctant to write a children&#39;s book but then realized that in herself and her three sisters she had the perfect models. The result was Little Women (1868) which became the earliest American children&#39;s novel to become a classic</p><h2>Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Edition (Haynes Manuals): An insight into the hardware from the first manned mission to land on the moon</h2><p>On 20 July 1969, US astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first men to walk on the moon. NASA Mission AS-506 Apollo 11 Owners&#39; Workshop Manual is the story of the Apollo 11 mission and the &#39;space hardware&#39; that made it all possible. This manual looks at the evolution and design of the mighty Saturn V rocket, the Command and Service Modules, and the Lunar Module. It describes the space suits worn by the crew and their special life support and communications systems. We learn about how the Apollo 11 mission was flown - from launch procedures to &#39;flying&#39; the Saturn V and the &#39;LEM&#39;, and from moon walking to the earth re-entry procedure. This new edition of the book celebrates the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing.</p><p>Dr Christopher Riley is a broadcaster and film-maker specializing in history and science documentaries.

Some of them play a valorous part; others, like the scapegrace Basil Sea, disclose their incorrigible habit of self-preservation in all circumstances. Basil&#39;s contribution to the war effort involves the use of his peculiar talents in such spheres of opportunity as the Ministry of Information and an obscure section of Military Security - adventures which incite Evelyn Waugh to another pungent satire upon the coteries of Mayfair.</p><p>8 1-hour cassettesEvelyn Waugh was born in Hampstead in 1903 and educated at Hertford College, Oxford. In 1928 he published his first novel, Decline and Fall, which was soon followed by Vile Bodies, Black Mischief (1932), A Handful of Dust (1934) and Scoop (1938). During these years he also travelled extensively and converted to Catholicism. In 1939 Waugh was commissioned in the Royal Marines and later transferred to the Royal Horse Guards, experiences which informed his Sword of Honour trilogy (1952-61). His most famous novel, Brideshead Revisited (1945), was written while on leave from the army.

This astute, deeply researched biography sheds a light on Tennessee Williams's warring family, his guilt, his creative triumphs and failures, his sexuality and numerous affairs, his misreported death, even the shenanigans surrounding his estate. <p>With vivid cameos of the formative influences in Williams's life&#x2015;his fierce, belittling father Cornelius; his puritanical, domineering mother Edwina; his demented sister Rose, who was lobotomized at the age of thirty-three; his beloved grandfather, the Reverend Walter Dakin&#x2015;<em>Tennessee Williams: Mad Pilgrimage of the Flesh</em> is as much a biography of the man who created <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>, <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>, and <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em> as it is a trenchant exploration of Williams&#x2019;s plays and the tortured process of bringing them to stage and screen.</p><p>The portrait of Williams himself is unforgettable: a virgin until he was twenty-six, he had serial homosexual affairs thereafter as well as long-time, bruising relationships with Pancho Gonzalez and Frank Merlo. With compassion and verve, Lahr explores how Williams's relationships informed his work and how the resulting success brought turmoil to his personal life.</p><p>Lahr captures not just Williams&#x2019;s tempestuous public persona but also his backstage life, where his agent Audrey Wood and the director Elia Kazan play major roles, and Marlon Brando, Anna Magnani, Bette Davis, Maureen Stapleton, Diana Barrymore, and Tallulah Bankhead have scintillating walk-on parts.

Led Zeppelin was the last great band of the 1960s and the first great band of the 1970s&#x2015;and <i>When Giants Walked the Earth </i>is the full, enthralling story of Zep from the inside, written by a former associate of both Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. Rich and revealing, it bores into not only the disaster, addiction and death that haunted the band but also into the real relationship between Page and Plant, including how it was influenced by Page's interest in the occult. Comprehensive and yet intimately detailed, <i>When Giants Walked the Earth </i>literally gets into the principals' heads to bring to life both an unforgettable band and an unrepeatable slice of rock history.</p></p><p><p>MICK WALL has written about music since 1977.

It is the summer of 1968 and you are one of the best-known guitarists in London &#x2013; and one of its least famous. Even the past two years in the Yardbirds haven&#x2019;t brought you the recognition you know you deserve. People talk about the Yardbirds as though Jeff Beck is still the guitarist, not you, despite everything you&#x2019;ve done for them; giving up the easy-money session gigs that bought you your house by the river; gifting them one last ride on the merry-go-round with ahead-of-the-game hits like &#x2018;Happening Ten Years Time Ago&#x2019;, even as Mickie Most sucked the life out of them making them do codswallop like &#x2018;Ha Ha Said The Clown&#x2019;; sticking with them as their profile has slowly faded from view, along with their own self-worth. They still mean something in America, just about, but back home they are dead meat. And what&#x2019;s the point in traipsing around America, them and the other half-dozen acts on the same poxy package bill, earning less in a week than you used to get for a day&#x2019;s worth of sessions, when no-one even knows your name, knows how important you are now to the whole set-up?<br>Jeff Beck? Jeff is an old mate, but who had recommended him for the job in the first place? Done him a favour when he was on his uppers? You &#x2013; Jimmy Page. The one who turned down the Yardbirds after Clapton had walked out, not because you were afraid, like Eric, that their craving for pop stardom would ruin your image as a &#x2018;blues purist&#x2019; &#x2013; you were never one of those, your love of folk, rock&#x2019;n&#x2019;roll, jazz, classical, Indian, Irish, anything and everything, meant you always felt sorry for those poor unfortunates that could only ever like one form of music &#x2013; but because you&#x2019;d secretly shuddered at the prospect of trawling the country&#x2019;s pubs and clubs, bouncing around in the back of a shitty bloody transit van like you&#x2019;d done before with Neil Christian and the Crusaders, ending up so ill you couldn&#x2019;t get out of bed for three days. Not even making any bread out of it. Stuff that for a game of soldiers.<br>And so you&#x2019;d recommended your old mate Jeff, who was just sat around doing nothing. Then stood back and watched as the Yardbirds with Beck had taken off like a rocket... &#x2018;For Your Love&#x2019;, &#x2018;Heart Full of Soul&#x2019;, &#x2018;Shapes of Things&#x2019;, hit after hit... Next thing you were in the Yardbirds too. It was never supposed to last, and you never made any promises, but you had to admit it was all right. Even when you were just supposed to be helping them out till they found a proper replacement for Samwell-Smith, twanging the bass as a bit of a laugh, the buzz was good. When they suggested moving Chris over onto bass and having you and Jeff both on guitar, you couldn&#x2019;t believe it! You did wonder how long Jeff would be able to hack it, but while it lasted it was actually really good. Not just the playing &#x2013; you and Jeff had always played well together &#x2013; but the vibe, the scene. It felt like an omen when you found yourself booked with them to appear in the Antonioni film, Blow Up. All you had to do was make like you were playing a club, steaming it, a great laugh. Though Jeff moaned when the old director asked him to smash his guitar. Six times he had to go through it, pretending to be Pete Townshend, before the old Italian was happy. God, did he moan! You just couldn&#x2019;t stop smiling though.<br>Then he left. Jeff Beck, the great guitar hero who had no discipline whatsoever, brilliant one night, less so the next; the so-called cool cat who couldn&#x2019;t write an original tune to save his life and had sold out to Mickie Most and his off-the-peg hits. Jeff is a mate and you don&#x2019;t like to bad-mouth him, but even Jeff knows &#x2018;Hi Ho Silver Lining&#x2019; was a load of old rubbish; everyone knows it was a load of old rubbish. Yet there it was as soon as he left the Yardbirds, courtesy of Mickie, in the charts and in the discotheques; on the radio and being danced to by all the leggy birds in their miniskirts on Top of the Pops.<br>Well, good for Jeff Beck, but what about you, Jimmy Page? What are you gonna do now Jeff has his own thing going and the Yardbirds have finally gone kaput? You don&#x2019;t know. Or rather, you do, but only on an instinctual level. You don&#x2019;t have the proof yet but the answer, you&#x2019;re fairly sure, is to take the Yardbirds and build on it, take their rinky-dink rock&#x2019;n&#x2019;roll and so-called experimentation &#x2013; their gimmicks &#x2013; and turn them into something much more deliberate; something that will make you gasp, not just sigh, something that will actually compete with Hendrix and Cream and the Stones and the bloody Beatles. Really show the world who&#x2019;s who and what&#x2019;s what.<br>But you are also wary of letting go of the bit of fame you&#x2019;ve finally found, however meagre. Most people may think Jeff Beck is still the guitar player in the Yardbirds but at least they&#x2019;ve heard of the Yardbirds. Who&#x2019;s heard of Jimmy Page, outside of the know-all producers and record company bigwigs, the studio broom-pushers and pretty receptionists? Outside of all the guitarists you&#x2019;ve replaced on sessions over the years &#x2013; the guy in Them, the guy in Herman&#x2019;s Hermits, the countless others whose faces you no longer remember and who would never acknowledge what you&#x2019;d done for them anyway, never thank you...<br>At least you know where you stand. Self-confident, well off, used to being on your own, you have always been someone who knew exactly where you stood, even as a kid playing on sessions for old timers like Val Doonican. You had always walked tall, always known your own worth even as others discounted it, sending you on your way to the next session &#x2013; sometimes as many as three a day, six days a week, never knowing what you were going to be asked to play next, picking up good money and taking none of the risks &#x2013; and none of the glory, either, when it worked.<br>Now it is your turn to shine. You are twenty-four, a hardened session pro who knows all about working in the studio, taking your cue from famous knob-twiddlers like Shel Talmy and Mickie Most, playing along with other session pros like Big Jim Sullivan and Bobby Graham, sharing a fag during tea breaks, taking it all in, crossing paths again and again over the years like lucky black cats. Now you want to do something for yourself. You&#x2019;ve always wanted it. Now it&#x2019;s time. Something big, like Eric with Cream &#x2013; only better. Like Jeff with Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood &#x2013; only better. Like George Harrison and Brian Jones with their sitars, even though you had one first &#x2013; only much, much better, you wait and bloody see.<br>First, though, you need to put the pieces together, find the corners of the jigsaw. The years working behind the scenes &#x2013; in the dark, a hired gun, doing as you were told, looking and listening and taking it all in, sharing a fag and laughing up your sleeve &#x2013; have taught you about more than just the playing. You now know where to place the mikes. &#x2018;Distance makes depth,&#x2019; as the old lags liked to say. You now know how to operate the desk, what makes bad groups good and good groups better. You now know it&#x2019;s about more than just being able to play, otherwise you&#x2019;d have been a star long ago. You have also learnt something about the business. You know the value of a name and of having the right record company behind you, the right guys in suits. And for that you know you will need help. You&#x2019;ve got a head start though. The Yardbirds still have a name &#x2013; just &#x2013; and you aren&#x2019;t about to let go of it. Not yet. You have to be sure first; have to be precise; your timing, as a pro, will have to be perfect, you know that.<br>The problem is time is running out. Only twenty-four but already the music is moving on without you. You wouldn&#x2019;t have said it out loud but you know it&#x2019;s true. Cream is already coming to its end and you feel like you haven&#x2019;t even started. Hendrix is now everybody&#x2019;s guitar god but you haven&#x2019;t shown them what you can do yet, given the opportunity, away from the sessions and the smoky studios and the bands crumbling from within, lost somewhere out there on the American road, just counting the days till something better comes along. Time is running out and though you&#x2019;d never say it out loud you are starting to worry you have missed the bloody boat; that if you&#x2019;re not careful you will have to go back to doing sessions. &#x2018;Becoming one of those sorts of people I hate,&#x2019; as you tell your friends.<br>The last Yardbirds tour comes to an end in Montgomery, Alabama, the gig at the Speedway Fairgrounds coming the day after Bobby Kennedy is shot in Los Angeles. You all watch it on TV back at the hotel and you all go &#x2018;wow&#x2019; and shake your heads and light more cigarettes. But it means nothing to you compared to the thought of the group breaking up. By the middle of June you are at home again in your groovy riverside abode in Pangbourne &#x2013; a converted Victorian boathouse thirty miles up the Thames from London with one of those basement boat moorings, not that you have a boat &#x2013; wondering what on earth you are going to do now.<br>Fortunately, you have an ace up your sleeve; someone who knows what you can do, who you are, what you could become, and who shares your determination to make something of it, to finally let the cat out of the bag: Peter Grant. &#x2018;G&#x2019;. The hulking, oversensitive giant who co-manages the Yardbirds with Mickie and who has kept you safe throughout your travels, especially on that bloody awful last American tour, when Keith Relf was going off the rails, getting drunk on stage every night and only Chris Dreja still se...</p></p><h2>Julip</h2><p>A completely re-edited version includes accompanying explanatory notes, an introduction to Shakespearean language, an account of Shakespeare&#39;s life, a portrait of the theater as it was in Shakespeare&#39;s era, and more. Original.</p><p><p><b>Jim Harrison </b>(1937-2016) was the author of over thirty-five books of poetry, nonfiction, and fiction, including <i>Legends of the Fall</i>, <i>The Road Home</i>, <i> The English Major</i>, and <i>The Farmer's Daughter</i>. His writing appeared in the<i> New Yorker</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, <i>Playboy</i>, and the<i> New York Times</i>. He earned a National Endowment for the Arts grant, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Spirit of the West Award from the Mountains &amp; Plains Booksellers Association. His work has been recognized worldwide and published in twenty-two languages.</p>A hit and two misses by novelist, poet, and journalist Harrison (Dalva, 1988; Legends of the Fall, 1979). These three novellas contrast the chaos of so-called civilization, signified by the havoc wreaked by the wantonness of the human libido, against the brutal yet orderly simplicity of nature. In the title piece, Julip tries to get her brother Bobby declared mentally incompetent and freed from prison, where he has been sent after shooting her three lovers. Although Julip willingly had sex with each of the victims, Bobby, who harbors sexual feelings for his sister, claims that he was only avenging his sister's defilement. Julip, a dog trainer, has long used her physical attractiveness to get what she wants, yet she is only truly at peace when she is among the animals she loves at her farm in rural Wisconsin. Overall, ``Julip'' is a nonstop joy ride of a read as the vibrant protagonist travels from Wisconsin to Florida using all of her considerable charm to spring her loved one from jail. More ponderous is ``The Seven-Ounce Man,'' about an errant Indian named Brown Dog, a character first introduced in Harrison's The Woman Lit By fireflies. Brown Dog is torn between his political principles and his libidinal and alcoholic impulses. Harrison is less effective when he forgoes plot and dialogue and lets his characters introspectively pontificate on the vagaries of human nature, as Brown Dog does here. The third novella, ``The Beige Dolorosa,'' is about a professor who traumatically loses his job over accusations of sexual harassment. Moving unwillingly to Arizona, the protagonist eventually finds the kind of spiritual fulfillment that has eluded him all of his life, yet not before one last, potentially disastrous flush of sexual desire. More philosophical than plot-driven, this last novella is the most blandly written; the more intellectual potential Harrison's characters possess, the less interesting they are. Hedonists, beware, Harrison seems to be saying; unchecked sexual desire leads to incest, infidelity, and prostitution. Mother Nature, on the other hand, offers a spiritual connection to an animal instinct untainted by modern neuroses. Like most people, Harrison's characters are caught right in the middle. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The first is a translation of selections from the Diamond Sutra itself, an ancient text comprised of conversations between the Buddha and his close disciple Subhuti. Considered a central work by Buddhists throughout the world, the Diamond Sutra has been the focus of much interpretation over the centuries. In the second layer, Geshe Michael quotes from some of the best commentaries of the Tibetan tradition. In the main text, the third layer, he uses both sutra and commentary as a jumping-off point for presenting his own teaching.<br><br>Geshe Michael gives fresh insight into ancient wisdom by using examples from his own experience as one of the founders of the Andin International Diamond Corporation, which was started with capital of fifty thousand dollars and which today has annual sales in excess of one hundred million dollars. Much of the success of Andin has come from applying the business strategies presented in <b>The Diamond Cutter</b>. Geshe Michael's easy style and spiritual understanding make this work of timeless wisdom an invaluable source for those already familiar with, and those unfamiliar with, Tibetan Buddhism.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Other Buddhist books offer you a path to happiness, Geshe Michael Roach offers a path to wealth. Roach, who while being a monk helped build a $100 million business, demonstrates how ancient notions in <i>The Diamond Cutter</i> sutra can help you succeed, and if you're in business that means to make money, a lot of it. Drawing on lessons he learned in the diamond business and years in Buddhist monasteries, Roach shows how taking care of others is the ultimate path to taking care of oneself, even--especially--in business. As he puts it, you have to engage in "mental gardening," which means doing certain practical things that will form new habits that will create an ideal reality for you. If this sounds a little outrageous, his very precise instructions are down to earth and address numerous specific issues common to the business/management world. Through this practice, you will become a considerate, generous, introspective, creative person of immense integrity, and that will be the key to your wealth. At first this book comes off like a gimmick and the writing isn't without rough patches, but page by page, as Roach introduces you to the practical details and real-life examples, his arguments become more convincing.

In an effort to retrieve his past, he withdraws to the family home somewhere in the hills between Milan and Turin. There, in the sprawling attic, he searches through boxes of old newspapers, comics, records, photo albums, and adolescent diaries. And so Yambo relives the story of his generation: Mussolini, Catholic education and guilt, Josephine Baker, Flash Gordon, Fred Astaire. His memories run wild, and the life racing before his eyes takes the form of a graphic novel. Yambo struggles through the frames to capture one simple, innocent image: that of his first love.<br><br> A fascinating, abundant novel-wide-ranging, nostalgic, funny, full of heart-from the incomparable Eco.</p><p>The premise of Umberto Eco's <i>The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana,</i> may strike some readers as laughably unpromising, and others as breathtakingly rich. A sixty-ish Milanese antiquarian bookseller nicknamed Yambo suffers a stroke and loses his memory of everything but the words he has read: poems, scenes from novels, miscellaneous quotations. His wife Paola fills in the bare essentials of his family history, but in order to trigger original memories, Yambo retreats alone to his ancestral home at Solara, a large country house with an improbably intact collection of family papers, books, gramophone records, and photographs. The house is a museum of Yambo's childhood, conventiently empty of people, except of course for one old family servant with a long memory--an apt metaphor for the mind. Yambo submerges himself in these artifacts, rereading almost everything he read as a school boy, blazing a meandering, sometimes misguided, often enchanting trail of words. Flares of recognition do come, like "mysterious flames," but these only signal that Yambo remembers something; they do not return that memory to him. It is like being handed a wrapped package, the contents of which he can only guess.<p> Within the limitations of Yambo's handicap and quest, Eco creates wondrous variety, wringing surprise and delight from such shamelessly hackneyed plot twists as the discovery of a hidden room. Illustrated with the cartoons, sheet music covers, and book jackets that Yambo uncovers in his search, <i>The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana</i> can be read as a love letter to literature, a layered excavation of an Italian boyhood of the 1940s, and a sly meditation on human consciousness. Both playful and reverent, it stands with <i>The Name of the Rose</i> and <i>The Island of the Day Before</i> as among Eco's most successful novels. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2005, 0-15-101144-0 <br></p><h2>Christmas in New York: A Pop-Up Book</h2><p>This interactive pop-up book makes the perfect gift for those who love the holiday traditions that originated in New York - from lighting the tree in Rockefeller Center to watching the ball drop on New Year&#39;s Eve.CHRISTMAS IN NEW YORK is a spectacular gift book featuring the world-famous holiday traditions of New York City presented in the three-dimensional art of a pop-up book.

In this classic summation of half a lifetime spent playing, watching and writing about the sport, he recounts the story of his overriding passion and tells us of the players whom he knew and loved, exploring the game&#39;s psychology and aesthetics, and the issues of class, race and politics that surround it. Part memoir of a West Indian boyhood, part passionate celebration and defence of cricket as an art form, part indictment of colonialism, &#34;Beyond a Boundary&#34; addresses not just a sport but a whole culture and asks the question, &#39;What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?&#39;</p><p>C L R James, historian, novelist, cultural critic and political activist, was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad in 1901. In 1932 he joined his friend Learie Constantine in Britain, where he became cricket correspondent of the Manchester Guardian. A central figure in the Pan-African movement and the struggle for colonial emancipation, he returned to Trinidad in 1958 in its run-up to independence. He later went back to London, where he died in 1989."Everything James has done has had the mark of originality, of his own flexible, sensitive, and deeply cultured intelligence. He conveys not a rigid doctrine but a delight and curiosity in all the manifestions of life, and the clue to everything lies in his proper appreciation of the game of cricket."&#x2014;E. P.

Commenting on this startling discovery at the time, noted Talmud scholar Daniel Boyarin argued that some Christians will find it shocking&#x2014;a challenge to the uniqueness of their theology.&#x201d;<br><br>Guiding us through a rich tapestry of new discoveries and ancient scriptures, <i>The Jewish Gospels</i> makes the powerful case that our conventional understandings of Jesus and of the origins of Christianity are wrong. In Boyarin&#x2019;s scrupulously illustrated account, the coming of the Messiah was fully imagined in the ancient Jewish texts. Jesus, moreover, was embraced by many Jews as this person, and his core teachings were not at all a break from Jewish beliefs and teachings. Jesus and his followers, Boyarin shows, were simply Jewish. What came to be known as Christianity came much later, as religious and political leaders sought to impose a new religious orthodoxy that was not present at the time of Jesus&#x2019;s life.<br><br>In the vein of Elaine Pagels&#x2019;s <i>The Gnostic Gospels</i>, here is a brilliant new work that will break open some of our culture&#x2019;s most cherished assumptions.<br></p><p><b>Daniel Boyarin</b>, Taubman Professor of Talmudic Culture and rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley, is the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships.

That also happens with couples -- indeed, above all with couples, because lovers fear more than anything else "losing sight" of the loved one.</p><p>With stunning artfulness in expanding and playing variations on the meaningful moment, Milan Kundera has made this situation -- and the vague sense of panic it inspires -- the very fabric of his new novel. Here brevity goes hand in hand with intensity, and a moment of bewilderment marks the start of a labyrinthine journey during which the reader repeatedly crosses the border between the real and the unreal, between what occurs in the world outside and what the mind creates in its solitude. </p><p>Of all contemporary writers, only Kundera can transform such a hidden and disconcerting perception into the material for a novel, one of his finest, most painful, and most enlightening. Which, surprisingly, turns out to be a love story.</p></p><p>The reader sits down to dinner with Chantal, who is waiting for her lover, Jean-Marc, in a seaside hotel. While waiting to be served, she overhears two waitresses discuss the unexplained disappearance of a family man. This blatant foreshadowing posits the central question of <i>Identity</i>: what we think we know about our intimates is predicated on projection, primal yearnings, and the deep denial of life's impermanence. <i>Identity</i> reads like a musical exercise; its playing out of themes is reminiscent of a fugue. An image dropped into the narrative will be revisited from a different vantage point, tossed back and forth between the lovers; out of it will be teased every possible meaning. The 51 sparse, tiny chapters reinforce the fuguelike feel. <p> The plot is simple: Jean-Marc arrives at the hotel; Chantal is out walking. Near misses and mistaken identities characterize his frantic search for her, offering Kundera the opportunity to philosophize on the unknowability of the "other." They reunite; Chantal blurts out the distressing thought that's plagued her day: "Men don't turn to look at me anymore." This launches the protagonists into sketchy flashbacks, stilted dialogues, and interior monologues, all loosely bound by their embarkation on an erotic journey. </p><p> Key bits from the characters' pasts become signature refrains. Chantal, for example, has buried a son, who died at the age of 5. Strands such as this are dropped lightly in the narrative, to be pulled through later chapters like a needle with different colored threads. Later, for example, the boy's death will trigger her unpleasant realization--that it was, in the end, a "dreadful gift." Children, she thinks, keep us hopeful in the world, because "it's impossible to have a child and despise the world as it is; that's the world we've put the child into." Thus, her child's death has set her free to live out her genuine disdain of the world. Although the illogical extremes of Kundera's thought can be wildly dissonant and wondrously shocking, this reiterative device of <i>Identity</i> lacks energy. There's no sense of discovery about these characters. They remain flat; the style effects one like an Ingmar Bergman film when one is in the mood for Sam Peckinpah. </p><p> As if in serendipitous response to her pain in getting older, Chantal receives an anonymous "love" note. More notes follow. Will they prove Jean-Marc's attempt to sweeten her sad disclosure? Her sexual awakening begins to blur the boundaries of what's real. All well and good, but somewhere along the line, Kundera concludes that Chantal is weak because she's older. Age, we are asked to believe, becomes a wedge between the lovers, even though Chantal is only a few years older than Jean-Marc, who is himself only 42. And in the exploration of her sexuality on the wax and wane, Kundera succumbs to clich�: she is consumed too often by too many flames, and red is all used up as a symbol of violent passion. On the subject of male and female desire, Kundera is incomparably funny, and the novel sports some nervy images--masturbating fetuses; our human community joined in a sea of saliva; the ubiquity of spying eyes, harvesting information for profit; the human gaze itself, a marvel, jaggedly interrupted by the mechanical action of the blink. Kundera betrays a witty revulsion for the values and mores of the late 20th century. </p><p> But with sentences such as, "This is the real and the only reason for friendship: to provide a mirror so the other person can contemplate his image from the past, which, without the eternal blah-blah of memories between pals, would long ago have disappeared," the reading experience reduces to an annoyance. Perhaps this is the fault of the translator attempting a breezy, colloquial tone. But it's sloppy and careless. Still the novel's an entertainment, a good companion. Reading it is like passing an afternoon in a sidewalk caf�, catching up with an old friend, say, with whom one has shared youthful cynicism and diatribes against the ignominies of human behavior. One will look back on such an afternoon and remember too many Galloises smoked, too many cups of coffee, moments of intense engagement that fell, alas, into the indulgence of a "retro" ennui.</p><p>Milan Kundera is the author of the novels <em>The Joke, Farewell Waltz, Life Is Elsewhere, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em>, and <em>Immortality</em>, and the short-story collection <em>Laughable Loves</em>&#x2014;all originally written in Czech.

With the potential to be an action-packed page-turner, this second installment of the "Mindwar" trilogy (Thomas Nelson) unfortunately falls short of expections. Uneven writing filled with unecessarily detailed descriptions and wordy exposition makes this volume a laborious read. The poorly conceived Virtual Reality world, which was introduced in the previous volume, reveals a lack of knowledge of video games and advanced technology. While the addition of a female protagonist, Molly, brings a new element to the story, there is little appeal to her character. Finally, the continued use of a variety of foreigners as the baddies, including Islamist and Russian terrorists, creates an unrealistic and negative global viewpoint.

His insights, forged in rugged encounters with the texts of the Old Testament, are sharp, painful, and indispensable. In the people Israel Brueggemann finds a model of an alternative community - anchored in YHWH, ever exploring new possibilities, and prophetically bent against empire. Part I: The Word Redescribing the World Part II: The Word Redefining the Possible Part III: The Word Shaping a Community of Discipleship</p><p>Walter Brueggemann, through his teaching, lecturing, and writing, has effectively demonstrated the significance of the Old Testament for our fractured world today. Recognized as the preeminent interpreter of the ancient texts in relation to questions posed by a variety of academic disciplines, he has shown the way toward a compelling understanding of the major components of the faith and life of ancient Israel, especially its Psalms, the prophets, and the narratives. His award-winning Theology of the Old Testament (Fortress Press, 1997) quickly became a foundational work in the field. <p>Patrick D. Miller is Charles T.

The spirited defence by Lt. Col. Munro of the 35th Regiment secured the British and Colonial troops the full honours of war, allowing them to march away with colours flying. <br>What happened next became the most infamous incident of the war - the 'massacre' of Fort William Henry. As the garrison prepared to march for Fort Edward a flood of enraged Native Americans swept over the column, unleashing an unstoppable tide of slaughter. The incident forms an integral part of James Fenimore Cooper's classic novel The Last of the Mohicans. It is this version, later dramatically reconstructed in the film versions of the story, that has coloured our view of the incident to this day. But what really happened? <br>As part of a wide-ranging British strategy, Colonial troops were dispatched to the southern end of Lake George in 1755. At the subsequent battle of Lake George, these troops repulsed a French attack before commencing construction of a fort close by: Fort William Henry. Developments on other fronts in 1756 meant little occurred at the fort that year, but in 1757 it became a focal point for French ambition. Its garrison withstood an initial siege in March, but the French returned in August with a large army, and, following a siege conducted along formal European lines, the British garrison surrendered and marched away - only to be swept up in the most infamous incident of the French and Indian War.<br>Much new research on this campaign - including some fascinating archaeological work - has taken place over the last 20 years and yet, for many, it is still the image created by Cooper's novel that colours our understanding of what happened at Fort William Henry. This new study will update that view.</p></p><p>Ian Castle has lived in London all his life and balances writing with work in the advertising industry.

Used books may not include companion materials, may have some shelf wear, may contain highlighting/notes, may not include CDs or access codes. 100% money back guarantee.</p><p><p>With his ten internationally acclaimed crime novels featuring Detective Harry Hole, Jo Nesbo has achieved an unparalleled success both in his native country Norway and abroad, winning the hearts of critics, booksellers and readers alike. Translated into more than forty languages, awarded a whole range of awards and boasting record-breaking sales, Nesbo has been lavishly praised by international critics for broadening the scope of the contemporary crime novel, and is today regarded as one the best crime writers of our time.</p><i>Excerpted from Chapter 1</i><br><b>Sydney</b><br>Something was wrong.<br><br>At first the female passport official had beamed: &#x201c;How are ya, mate?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; Harry Hole had lied. It was more than thirty hours since he had taken off from Oslo via London, and after the change of planes in Bahrain he had sat in the same bloody seat by the emergency exit. For security reasons it could only be tipped back a little, and his lumbar region had almost crumbled by the time they reached Singapore.<br><br>And now the woman behind the counter was no longer smiling.<br><br>She had scrutinized his passport with conspicuous interest. Whether it was the photograph or his name that had initially put her in such a cheery mood was hard to say.<br><br>&#x201c;Business?&#x201d;<br><br>Harry Hole had a suspicion that passport officials in most places in the world would have added a &#x201c;sir,&#x201d; but he had read that this type of formal pleasantry wasn&#x2019;t especially widespread in Australia. It didn&#x2019;t �really matter; Harry wasn&#x2019;t particularly accustomed to foreign travel or snobbish&#x2014;all he wanted was a hotel room and a bed as quickly as possible.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he had replied, drumming his fingers on the counter.<br><br>And that was when her lips had pursed, turned ugly and articulated, with a pointed tone: &#x201c;Why isn&#x2019;t there a visa in your passport, sir?&#x201d;<br><br>His heart sank, as it invariably did when there was a hint of a catastrophe in the offing. Perhaps &#x201c;sir&#x201d; was used only when situ�ations became critical?<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, I forgot,&#x201d; Harry mumbled, searching feverishly through his inside pockets. Why had they not been able to pin a special visa in his passport as they do with standard visas? Behind him in the queue he heard the faint drone of a Walkman and realized it was his traveling companion from the plane. He had been playing the same cassette the whole flight. Why the hell could he never remember which pocket he put things in? It was hot as well, even though it was getting on for ten o&#x2019;clock at night. Harry could feel his scalp beginning to itch.<br><br>At last he found the document and placed it on the count�er, to his great relief.<br><br>&#x201c;Police officer, are you?&#x201d;<br><br>The passport official looked up from the special visa and studied him, but the pursed mouth was gone.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope no Norwegian blondes have been murdered?&#x201d;<br><br>She chuckled and smacked the stamp down hard on the special visa.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, just the one,&#x201d; Harry Hole answered.<br><br>The arrivals hall was crowded with travel reps and limousine drivers, holding up signs with names on, but not a Hole in sight. He was on the point of grabbing a taxi when a black man wearing light blue jeans and a Hawaiian shirt, and with an unusually broad nose and dark, curly hair plowed a furrow between the signs and came striding �toward him.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Holy, I presume!&#x201d; he declared triumphantly.<br><br>Harry Hole considered his options. He had decided to spend the first days in Australia correcting the pronunciation of his surname so that he wouldn&#x2019;t be confused with apertures or orifices. Mr. Holy however, was infinitely preferable.<br><br>&#x201c;Andrew Kensington. How are ya?&#x201d; the man grinned and stuck out an enormous fist.<br><br>It was nothing less than a juice extractor.<br><br>&#x201c;Welcome to Sydney. Hope you enjoyed the flight,&#x201d; the stranger said with evident sincerity, like an echo of the air hostess&#x2019;s announcement twenty minutes earlier. He took Harry&#x2019;s battered suitcase and began to walk �toward the exit without a backward glance. Harry kept close to him.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you work for Sydney police?&#x201d; he initiated.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure do, mate. Watch out!&#x201d;<br><br>The swing door hit Harry in the face, right on the hooter, and made his eyes water. A bad slapstick sketch could not have started worse. He rubbed his nose and swore in Norwegian. Kensington sent him a sympathetic look.<br><br>&#x201c;Bloody doors, eh?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Harry didn&#x2019;t answer. He didn&#x2019;t know how to answer that sort of comment down under.<br><br>In the car park Kensington unlocked the boot of a small, well-�used Toyota and shoved in the suitcase. &#x201c;Do you wanna drive, mate?&#x201d; he asked in surprise.<br><br>Harry realized he was sitting in the driver&#x2019;s seat. Of course, they drove on the bloody left in Australia. However, the passenger seat was so full of papers, cassettes and general rubbish that Harry squeezed into the back.<br><br>&#x201c;You must be an Aboriginal,&#x201d; he said as they turned onto the motorway.<br><br>&#x201c;Guess there&#x2019;s no fooling you, Officer,&#x201d; Kensington answered, glancing in the mirror.<br><br>&#x201c;In Norway we call you Australian Negroes.&#x201d;<br><br>Kensington kept his eyes trained on the mirror. &#x201c;�Really?&#x201d;<br><br>Harry began to feel ill at ease. &#x201c;Er, by that I just mean that your forefathers obviously didn&#x2019;t belong to the convicts sent here from �En�gland two hundred years ago.&#x201d; He wanted to show he had at least a modicum of knowledge about the country&#x2019;s history.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Holy. My forefathers were here a bit before them. Forty thousand years, to be precise.&#x201d;<br><br>Kensington grinned into the mirror. Harry vowed to keep his mouth shut for a while.<br><br>&#x201c;I see. Call me Harry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;OK, Harry. I&#x2019;m Andrew.&#x201d;<br><br>Andrew ran the conversation for the rest of the ride. He drove Harry to King&#x2019;s Cross, holding forth the whole way: this area was Sydney&#x2019;s red-�light district and the center for the drugs trade and to a large extent all the other shady dealings in town. Every second scandal seemed to have a connection with some hotel or strip joint inside this square kilometer.<br><br>&#x201c;Here we are,&#x201d; Andrew said suddenly. He pulled in to the curb, jumped out and took Harry&#x2019;s suitcase from the boot.<br><br>&#x201c;See you tomorrow,&#x201d; Andrew said, and with that he and the car were gone. With a stiff back and jet lag beginning to announce its presence, Harry and his suitcase were now alone on a pavement in a town boasting a population roughly equivalent to the whole of Norway, outside the splendid Crescent Hotel. The name was printed on the door next to three stars. Oslo&#x2019;s Chief Constable was not known for largesse with regards to accommodation for her employees. But perhaps this one was not going to be too bad after all. There must have been a civil service discount and it was probably the hotel&#x2019;s smallest room, Harry reflected.<br><br>And it was.<br><br>2<br><br>Gap Park<br><br>Harry knocked warily on the door of the Head of Crime Squad for Surry Hills.<br><br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; boomed a voice from inside.<br><br>A tall, broad man with a stomach designed to impress was standing by the window, behind an oak desk. Beneath a thinning mane protruded gray bushy eyebrows, but the wrinkles around his eyes smiled.<br><br>&#x201c;Harry Holy from Oslo, Norway, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Take a pew, Holy. You look bloody fit for this time of the morning. I hope you haven&#x2019;t been to see any of the boys in Narc, have you?&#x201d; Neil McCormack let out a huge laugh.<br><br>&#x201c;Jet lag. I&#x2019;ve been awake since four this morning, sir,&#x201d; Harry explained.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. Just an in-�joke. We had a pretty high-�profile corruption case here a couple of years back, you see. Ten officers were convicted, among other things for selling drugs&#x2014;to one another. Suspicion was raised because a couple of them were so alert&#x2014;round the clock. No joke �really.&#x201d; He chuckled contentedly, put on his glasses and flicked through the papers in front of him.<br><br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;ve been sent here to assist us with our investigation into the murder of Inger Holter, a Norwegian citizen with a permit to work in Australia. Blonde, good-�looking girl, according to the photos. Twenty-�three years old, wasn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br><br>Harry nodded. McCormack was serious now.<br><br>&#x201c;Found by fishermen on the ocean side of Watson&#x2019;s Bay&#x2014;to be more precise, Gap Park. Semi-�naked. Bruising suggested she had been raped first and then strangled, but no semen was found. Later transported at the dead of night to the park where the body was dumped off the cliff.&#x201d;<br><br>He pulled a face.<br><br>&#x201c;Had the weather been a little worse the waves would definitely have carried her out, but instead she lay among the rocks until she was found. As I said, there was no semen present, and the reason for that is that the vagina was sliced up like a filleted fish and the seawater did a thorough job of washing this girl clean. Therefore we have no fingerprints either, though we do have a rough estimate of time of death . . .&#x201d; McCormack removed his glasses and rubbed his face. &#x201c;But we don&#x2019;t have a murderer. And what the hell are you gonna do about that, Mr. Holy?&#x201d;<br><br>Harry was about to answer but was interrupted.<br><br>&#x201c;What you&#x2019;re gonna do is watch carefully while we haul the bastard in, tell the Norwegian press along the way what a wonderful job we&#x2019;re doing together&#x2014;making sure we don&#x2019;t offend anyone at the Norwegian Embassy, or relatives&#x2014;and otherwise enjoy a break and send a card or two to your dear Chief Constable. How is she by the way?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, as far as I know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great woman, she is. I s&#x2019;pose she explained to you what&#x2019;s expected of you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To some extent. I&#x2019;m taking part in an invest&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great. Forget all that. Here are the new rules. Number one: from now on you listen to me, me and me alone. Number two: you don&#x2019;t take part in anything you haven&#x2019;t been instructed to do by me. And number three: one toe out of line and you&#x2019;ll be on the first plane home.&#x201d;<br><br>This was delivered with a smile, but the message was clear: paws off, he was here as an observer. He might just as well have brought his swimming things and a camera along.<br><br>&#x201c;I gather that Inger Holter was some kind of TV celeb in Norway?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A minor celeb, sir. She hosted a children&#x2019;s program broadcast a couple of years ago. I suppose before this happened she was on her way into oblivion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;ve been told that your papers are making a big thing of this murder. Couple of them have sent people here already. We&#x2019;ve given &#x2019;em what we&#x2019;ve got, and that&#x2019;s not a great deal, so they&#x2019;ll soon be bored and bugger off home. They don&#x2019;t know you&#x2019;re here. We&#x2019;ve got our own nannies, so you won&#x2019;t have to take care of them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you for that, sir,&#x201d; Harry said, and he meant it. The thought of panting Norwegian journalists looking over his shoulder was not a welcome one.<br><br>&#x201c;OK, Holy, I&#x2019;ll be honest with you and tell you how the land lies. I&#x2019;ve been told in no uncertain terms by my governor that councillors in Sydney would like to see this case cleared up as soon as possible. As usual, it&#x2019;s all about politics and dosh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dosh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, we reckon unemployment in Sydney will rise to over ten percent this year, and the town needs every cent we can get from the tourists. We&#x2019;ve got the Olympic Games just round the corner, in 2000, and tourism from Scandinavia&#x2019;s on the up. Murder, especially one which hasn&#x2019;t been cleared up, isn&#x2019;t a good advert for the town, so we&#x2019;re doing what we can. We have a team of four detectives on the case plus high-�priority access to the force&#x2019;s resources&#x2014;all the computers, forensic staff, lab people. And so on.&#x201d;<br><br>McCormack pulled out a sheet of paper which he studied with a frown.<br><br>&#x201c;In fact, you should be working with Watkins, but since you specifically asked for Kensington, I see no reason to refuse your request.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, to my knowledge I haven&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kensington&#x2019;s a good man. There are not many Indigenous officers who have come up through the ranks like him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No?&#x201d;<br><br>McCormack shrugged. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just the way it is. Well, Holy, if there&#x2019;s anything else, you know where I hang out. Any questions?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Er, just a formality, sir. I was wondering whether sir was the right mode of address to a superior officer in this country, or whether it was a little too . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Formal? Stiff? Yes, I guess it probably is. But I like it. It reminds me that I am in fact the boss of this outfit.&#x201d; McCormack burst out laughing and concluded the meeting with a bone-�crunching handshake.<br><br>&#x201c;January&#x2019;s the tourist season in Australia,&#x201d; Andrew explained as they lurched forward in the traffic around Circular Quay.<br><br>&#x201c;Everyone comes to see the Sydney Opera House and go on boat trips round the harbor and admire the women on Bondi Beach. Shame you&#x2019;ve got to work.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry shook his head. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t matter. I break out in a cold sweat around tourist traps.&#x201d;<br><br>They emerged onto New South Head Road, where the Toyota sped eastward to Watson&#x2019;s Bay.<br><br>&#x201c;The East Side of Sydney&#x2019;s not exactly like the East End of London,&#x201d; Andrew explained as they passed one fashionable house after another. &#x201c;This district&#x2019;s called Double Bay. We call it Double Pay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where did Inger Holter live?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She lived with her boyfriend in Newtown for a while before they split up and she moved to a little one-�room flat in Glebe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boyfriend?&#x201d;<br><br>Andrew shrugged. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s Australian, a computer engineer and met her when she came here on holiday two years ago. He&#x2019;s got an alibi for the night of the murder and is not exactly the prototype of a murderer. But you never know, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>They parked below Gap Park, one of Sydney&#x2019;s many green lungs. Steep stone steps led up to the windblown park that lay high above Watson&#x2019;s Bay to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The heat hit them when they opened the car doors. Andrew put on a big pair of shades, which made Harry think of a laid-�back porn king. For some reason his Australian colleague was wearing a tight suit today, and Harry thought the broad-�shouldered black man looked a bit comical as he rolled and pitched up the path in front of him to the viewpoint.<br><br>Harry looked around. To the west he saw the city center with the Harbor Bridge, to the north the beach and yachts in Watson&#x2019;s Bay and, further in the distance, verdant Manly, the suburb on the northern side of the bay. To the east the horizon curved in a spectrum of various shades of blue. The cliffs plunged down in front of them, and way below the ocean breakers ended their long voyage in a thunderous crescendo among the rocks.<br><br>Harry felt a bead of sweat running down between his shoulder blades. This heat was giving him goose pimples.<br><br>&#x201c;You can see the Pacific Ocean from here, Harry.

When you stay at a hotel you're living for one day in a place where you don't normally live. That feeling can be true with photographs, too." LaChapelle's photographs can be spotted a mile away. If you read magazines, you know his work: it jumps out like none other with the expertly created environments and alternate realities in which he places his subjects. These universes are complete and constantly evolving to fit dynamic personalities. <i>Hotel LaChapelle</i> is filled with a celebrity cast as well as what LaChapelle calls "characters on the peripheries." The colors are as vibrant and inorganic as the settings that encapsulate his models. In this world, heads are sewn onto different-colored bodies, a nurse holds a face with a pair of tweezers, Marilyn Manson works as a school crossing guard, Madonna is a Krishna goddess, Leonard DiCaprio becomes Marlon Brando, and Ewan McGregor's face peers into a dollhouse while his body bleeds from a gunshot wound fired from Barbie's diminutive gun. The list goes on, and what it says about LaChapelle's vision is that excess is never too much. <i>--Amra Brooks</i>David LaChapelle has been called the Fellini of photography and is one of the hottest young photographers working today. Originally trained as a fine artist, LaChapelle turned to photography when he worked for Interview magazine as a teenager. His career has grown steadily ever since but it exploded in the 90s with the development of his signature style and as the leader of the New Surrealist pop-photography movement.

How then, do blind or partially sighted people capture such extraordinary images?<br><br> The photographs in this revelatory book suggest a deeper truth: that blindness is itself a kind of seeing, and that those who can see are often blind to the strangeness and beauty of the world around them.

Can addiction be overcome by mustering the strength of character to turn away from such choices? Psychologist Schaler (Justice, Law, and Society/American Univ.; Smoking, Who Has the Right?, not reviewed) argues convincingly that society has erred in giving in completely to the AA vision that addiction is a disease, that addicts can't help themselves, and that they need a higher power to be saved. Addiction (which at one time meant only devotion or dedication) has come to mean ``any activity which individuals engage in, deliberately and consciously, and are physically unable to stop themselves from pursuing. Rejecting such a definition out of hand, Schaler maintains that ``people are responsible for their deliberate and conscious behavior. He is sympathetic for those struggling with addiction; he doesn't oversimplify his own or his opponents arguments; and he readily acknowledges his philosophical forefathers (Thomas Szasz, for one, from the last time the pendulum was at this end of its arc). His reading of the results of research into addictionthat it fails to support the disease modelis convincing. And his resulting suggestions for changes in public policy and for individual change demand consideration. If not a new model for viewing addiction, at least a provocative update of an old one. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>A clear and fascinating read. The wealth of information and fresh insights reflect the writer's career as a scholar-teacher-therapist, and especially his many years of research and practical work in the addiction field.

Millions of people have stopped smoking, abusing mind-altering drugs, and drinking addictively on their own, without the intervention of counselors or doctors or programs. Dr. Schaler explains persuasively why and how this happens, despite all the genetic and hormonal predispositions. -- <i>Joseph Gerstein, M.D. F.A.C.P., Harvard Medical School</i><br><br>This is indeed a rare book. Schaler has provided a unique, masterly work which explains addiction from a revelatory perspective.

Sisters Iphigenia, Margarita and Carla live in a ruined monastery on a remote Australian island, tending their only flock: the Agnes sisters, sheep named for nuns who have died. The rhythm of life is seasonal and canonical: washing day, shearing day, Christmas, Lent. It's hard to say what year it is... until Father Ignatius arrives with a cellular phone to assess what he thought was abandoned property. A career churchman, Ignatius wants to turn a profit by transforming the forgotten nunnery into a luxury retreat for businessmen. The story takes a Stephen King turn when the nuns realize that the priest's plans threaten them. Ignatius is drugged with herbal tea, stripped, shaved and plastered up to the waist in a cast. Still, the priest's presence provokes different reactions from each nun, stirring up long-dormant secrets that threaten to tear apart their community. Ignatius himself undergoes something more than a physical transformation as he is forced to reassess the meaning of his mission in the church. Although Day has undeniable storytelling gifts and weaves together an impressive number of storytelling traditions (classical, biblical, Celtic and fairy tale), the novel's rather kitschy setup and often gruesomely graphic feminist symbolism may force even sympathetic readers to share Ignatius's feeling that "There were parts of the story that even he was having trouble swallowing."

Her dreams of becoming an author started in algebra class, where she spent her time writing short stories... therefore explaining her dismal grades in math.</p><p>The Greek gods engage in modern-day power struggles in the solid inaugural installment of the Titan new adult paranormal romance series. Seth, an otherworld/human hybrid introduced in Armentrout&#x2019;s well-received Covenant YA series, bears a heavy burden of guilt over his past treacherous acts. He redeems himself by becoming Apollo&#x2019;s judge and jury, meting out bloody justice to traitorous lesser gods and mortals.

She had prepared the manuscript during very trying times. Her trial under the Smith Act took place in Foley Square, New York, in 1952. In the years immediately following, she was engaged in the exhausting processes of appeal and defense, not only in her case but on behalf of the many Communist leaders who were victims of that thought-control prosecution. She began serving her sentence at the Federal Women's Reformatory at Alverson, West Virginia in January 1955 and was not released until May 1957. The book first appeared, under the imprint of Masses &amp; Mainstream, in November 1955. While in prison she was not permitted to see the proofs (nor the book when it appeared). She thus had no opportunity to make final corrections before quotation. Fortunately, Ms. Flynn left among her papers and marked copy of the book, in which she noted some corrections. These have been included in the present edition. She had also plans to give the book a more thorough critical reading, but did not manage to do so before death. However, when she asked International Publishers to reissue the book, she urged that it be completely reedited to correct the errors and smooth out the rough spots. This is been done for the present edition.... That Elizabeth Gurly Flynn never completed her autobiography is an inestimable loss. She would have written about the climactic events of the later years, it was she was deeply engaged, with the same understanding, sensitivity, with, and devotion to working people and socialism that marker story of the early years. --- excerpts from Editor's Notes</p><p></p><h2>The Revelation (Abram&#x2019;s Daughters)</h2><p>&#34;Conclusion to the series spanning three generations in a quaint Old Order Amish community.

It is her wish to wear, like the women around her, a malafa, or airy, colorful cloth worn over clothes and covering the head. Lalla wants to wear the malafa for its beauty, but her mother explains that the cloth&#x2019;s purpose is for more than beauty. She tells her sister, Selma, that she wants to wear it to be mysterious; Selma laughs and says that isn&#x2019;t a good enough reason. Neither is Lalla&#x2019;s desire to transition from a girl to a woman. Only when she tells her mother that I want a malafa so I can pray like you do does she receive her coveted cloth. Cunnane explains in an author&#x2019;s note that when she first lived in Mauritania, she believed wearing the veil was repressive, but the people&#x2019;s relaxed and colorful expression of their faith and culture changed her mind. She will certainly make readers think about their preconceived notions thanks to a text that is as thoughtful as it is charming. Hadadi, who is Iranian, creates paper collages with a whimsical beauty that work well with the story&#x2019;s sense of longing. The women, all individualized, exude true warmth, and readers will feel a quiet satisfaction when Lalla joins them. A special offering.

Ms. Deveraux lives in Connecticut.<p><b>Chapter One</b><br> </p><p> ENGLAND<br> 1988<br> </p><p> Dougless Montgomery sat in the backseat of the rental car, Robert and his pudgy thirteen-year-old daughter, Gloria, in the front. As usual, Gloria was eating. Dougless shifted her slim legs to try to make herself more comfortable around Gloria's luggage. There were six large pieces of matched leather luggage to hold Gloria's belongings, and since they wouldn't fit in the trunk of the little car, they were piled in the back with Dougless. There was a makeup case under her feet and a big wardrobe on the seat beside her. Every time she moved, she scraped against a buckle, a welt, or a handle. Right now, she had an itch under her left knee, but she couldn't reach it. </p><p> "Daddy," Gloria whined, sounding like an invalid four-year-old, "she's scratching the pretty suitcases you bought me." </p><p> Dougless clenched her fists, closed her eyes, and counted to ten. <i>She.</i> Gloria never said Dougless's name, but just called her <i>She.</i> </p><p> Robert glanced over his shoulder at Dougless. "Dougless, could you please be a bit more careful? That luggage is quite expensive." </p><p> "I am aware of that," Dougless said, trying to keep the anger out of her voice. "It's just that I'm having a difficult time sitting back here. There isn't much room." </p><p> Robert gave a great sigh of weariness. "Dougless, do you have to complain about everything? Can't you even allow a vacation to be pleasant? All I asked was that you make an effort." </p><p> Dougless opened her mouth to reply but closed it. She didn't want to start another argument. Besides, she knew that it would do no good. So, instead of replying, she swallowed her anger -- then rubbed her stomach. It was hurting again. She wanted to ask Robert to stop to get something to drink so she could take one of the tranquilizers the doctor had prescribed for her nervous stomach. "Keep this up and you'll give yourself an ulcer," the doctor had warned her. But Dougless wouldn't give Gloria the satisfaction of knowing that she'd yet again managed to upset Dougless and to, yet again, drive a wedge between Dougless and Robert. </p><p> But when Dougless glanced up, she saw Gloria smirking at her in the makeup mirror on the sun visor. With determination, Dougless looked away and tried to concentrate on the beauty of the English countryside. </p><p> Outside the car window she saw green fields, old stone fences, cows and more cows, picturesque little houses, magnificent mansions, and...and Gloria, she thought. Dougless seemed to see Gloria everywhere. Robert kept saying, "She's just a child and her daddy has left her. It's only natural that she's going to have some hostility toward you. But please try to show some sympathy for her, will you? She's really a sweet kid when you get to know her." </p><p> A sweet kid, Dougless thought as she looked out the window. At thirteen, Gloria wore more makeup than Dougless did at twenty-six -- and Gloria spent hours in the hotel bathroom applying it. Gloria sat in the front of the car. "She's just a kid and it's her first trip to England," Robert said. "And you've been to England before, so why not be generous?" That Dougless was supposed to read the road map when she could hardly see around Gloria's head didn't seem to count for much. </p><p> Dougless tried to concentrate on the scenery. Robert said Dougless was jealous of his daughter. He said that she didn't want to share him with anyone else, but that if she'd just relax, they'd be a very happy threesome. "We could be a second family for a little girl who has lost so much," he said. </p><p> Dougless had tried to like Gloria. She'd tried hard to be an adult and ignore, and even understand, Gloria's hostility, but it was more than Dougless could do. In the year she and Robert had been living together, Dougless had made every possible effort to find that "sweet kid" that Robert had told her of. Several times, she'd taken Gloria shopping and spent more money on Gloria than Dougless's small elementary school teacher's salary allowed her to spend on herself. Several Saturday nights Dougless had stayed at the house she shared with Robert, babysitting Gloria while he went to professional functions, usually cocktail parties or dinners. When Dougless had said she'd like to attend with him, Robert had said, "But time alone is what you two need. You need to get to know each other. And, remember, babe, I'm a package deal. Love me, love my kid." </p><p> Sometimes Dougless had started to believe that it was beginning to work because she and Gloria were cordial, even friendly, to each other when they were alone. But the minute Robert appeared, Gloria changed into a whining, lying brat. She sat on Robert's lap, all five foot two inches, one hundred and forty pounds of her, and wailed that <i>She</i> had been "awfully mean" to her. </p><p> At first Dougless had laughed at what Gloria was saying. How absurd to think she would ever harm a child! Anyone could see that the girl was just trying to get her father's attention. </p><p> But to Dougless's utter disbelief, Robert believed every word his daughter said. He didn't accuse Dougless. No, instead, he just asked her to be a "little kinder" to "the poor kid." Immediately, Dougless's defenses had gone up. "Is that supposed to mean you don't think I'm a kind person? You <i>do</i> think I would mistreat a child?" </p><p> "I'm just asking you to be the adult and have a little patience and understanding, that's all." </p><p> When Dougless asked what he meant by that, Robert had thrown up his hands and said that he couldn't talk to her; then he'd walked out of the room. Dougless had taken two of her stomach tranquilizers. </p><p> After the arguments, Dougless had wavered between guilt and rage. She had a classroom of children who adored her, yet Gloria seemed to hate her. <i>Was</i> Dougless jealous? Was she somehow unconsciously letting this child know she didn't want to share Robert with his own daughter? Every time Dougless thought of her possible jealousy she vowed to try harder to make Gloria like her, which usually meant she bought Gloria another expensive gift. And she'd again agree to babysit on the weekends when Gloria stayed with them. While Gloria's mother had a <i>life,</i> Dougless thought with bitterness. </p><p> At other times, all Dougless felt was rage. Couldn't Robert just once -- <i>one</i> time -- take Dougless's side? Couldn't he tell Gloria that Dougless's comfort was more important than the blasted suitcases? Or maybe he could tell Gloria that Dougless had a name and wasn't always to be referred to as <i>she</i> or <i>her?</i> But every time Dougless said something like that to Robert, she ended up apologizing. Robert said, "My God, Dougless, you're the adult. And I only see her on alternate weekends, so of course I'm going to favor her over you. You and I are together every day, so why can't you stand to play second fiddle now and then?" </p><p> His words sounded right, but at the same time, Dougless fantasized about Robert telling his daughter to "be more respectful" toward the "woman I love." </p><p> But that didn't happen, so Dougless kept her mouth shut and enjoyed the time she and Robert had when Gloria wasn't around. When Gloria wasn't with them, she and Robert were perfectly suited, and she knew, through age old intuition, that very soon she was going to receive what she wanted so much: a marriage proposal. </p><p> Truthfully, marriage was what Dougless wanted most in life. She'd never been burning with ambition the way her older sisters were. Dougless just wanted a nice home and a husband, and a few children. Maybe someday, after the kids were in school, she'd write children's books, something about talking animals, but she had no desire to fight her way up a corporate ladder. </p><p> Already, she'd invested eighteen months of her life in Robert, and he was perfect husband material. He was tall, handsome, well-dressed, and an excellent orthopedic surgeon. He always hung up his clothes, and he helped with the housework; he didn't chase after women, and he always came home when he said he would. He was reliable, dependable, faithful -- but, most important, he needed her so very much. </p><p> Not long after they met, Robert had told Dougless his life story. As a child, he hadn't been loved very much, and he told Dougless that her sweet, generous heart was what he'd been looking for all his life. His first wife, whom he'd divorced over four years ago, was a cold fish, a woman who Robert said was incapable of love. Just three months after he met Dougless, he told her he wanted a "permanent relationship" with her -- which she took to mean marriage -- but first he wanted to know how they "related" to each other. After all, he'd been hurt so badly the first time. In other words, he wanted them to live together. </p><p> What he said made sense to her, and since Dougless had had a number of "unfortunate" previous relationships with men, she happily moved into Robert's big, beautiful, expensive house, then set about doing everything she could to prove to Robert that she was as warm and generous and loving as his mother and wife had been cold. </p><p> With the exception of dealing with Gloria, living with Robert had been great. He was an energetic man and they often went dancing, hiking, bicycle riding. They entertained a great deal and often went to parties. She'd never lived with a man before, but she had easily settled into a domestic routine, feeling as though it was what she was made for. </p><p> They had problems other than Gloria, of course, but Robert was so much better than any of the other men Dougless had dated that she forgave him his little quirks -- most of which revolved around money. True, it was annoying that when they went to the grocery together he nearly always "forgot" his checkbook. And at the ticket window of theaters and when the check was presented in restaurants, half the time Robert found he'd left his wallet at home. If Dougless complained, he'd talk to her about the new age of liberated women and how most women were fighting to pay half the expenses. Then he'd kiss her sweetly and take her somewhere expensive for dinner -- and he'd pay. And Dougless forgave him. </p><p> Dougless knew she could stand the small problems -- everyone had idiosyncracies -- but it was Gloria that sent her screaming. When Gloria was with them, their life turned into a battleground. According to Robert, his daughter was perfection on earth, and because Dougless didn't see her that way, Robert began to see Dougless as the enemy. When the three of them were together, it was Robert and Gloria on one team and Dougless on the other. </p><p> Now, on this holiday in England, in the front seat Gloria offered her father a piece of candy from the box on her lap. Neither of them seemed to think of offering any to Dougless. </p><p> Still looking out the window, Dougless gritted her teeth. Perhaps it was the combination of Gloria and money that was making her so angry, because, with this trip, Robert's little "money quirk" as Dougless had always thought of it, had turned into something more. </p><p> When Dougless had first met Robert, they had talked for hours about their dreams and they'd talked many times of taking a trip to England. As a child, she had often traveled to England with her family, but she hadn't been back in years. When she and Robert had moved in together, in September of last year, Robert had said, "Let's go to England one year from today. By then we'll know." He hadn't elaborated on what they would "know," but Dougless was sure that he meant that, in a year, they'd know whether or not they were compatible for marriage. </p><p> For a whole year, Dougless had worked on planning the trip, which she'd come to think of as their honeymoon. A "pre-honeymoon," she called it in her mind. "The decision maker," she said to herself, then smiled. She made reservations at the most romantic, most exclusive country house hotels England had to offer. When she had asked Robert's opinion of a hotel, he'd winked at her and said, "Spare no expense for this trip." She had ordered brochures, bought travel books, read and researched until she knew the names of half the villages in England. Robert's only stipulation had been that he wanted an educational trip as well as fun, so she'd compiled a list of many things to do that were close to their lovely hotels -- which was easy to do, since Great Britain is like a Disneyland for history lovers. </p><p> Then, three months before they were to leave, Robert said that he had a surprise for her on this trip, a very, very special surprise that was going to fill her with joy. His words had made Dougless work even harder on the plans, and she found their little game of secrecy exciting. As Dougless planned, she thought, Will he propose here? Or maybe here. This place would be nice. </p><p> Three weeks before they left, she was balancing Robert's household-accounts checkbook when she saw a canceled check for five thousand dollars made out to a jewelry store. </p><p> As she held the check, tears of happiness came to her eyes. "An engagement ring," she'd whispered. That Robert had spent so much was proof that even though he was a tad stingy on small things, when something really counted, he was generous. </p><p> For the next few weeks Dougless had walked on clouds. She cooked wonderful meals for Robert and had been especially energetic in the bedroom, doing everything she could think of to please him. </p><p> Two days before they were to leave, Robert punctured her bubble a bit -- not enough to burst it, but it had certainly been deflated. He had asked to see the bills for the trip, plane tickets, advance reservations, whatever she had. He had then added the amounts and handed her the calculator tape. </p><p> "This is your half of the cost," he'd said. </p><p> "Mine?" she'd asked stupidly, not understanding what he was saying. </p><p> "I know how important it is to you women today to pay your own way, so I don't want to be accused of being a male chauvinist pig," he'd said with a smile. "You don't want to be a burden to a man, do you? You don't want to add to all my responsibilities at the hospital and to my ex-wife, do you?" </p><p> "No, no, of course not," Dougless had mumbled, feeling confused, as she often did when confronted with Robert's reasoning. "It's just that I don't have any money." </p><p> "Dougless, baby, please tell me that you don't spend everything you make. Maybe you should take a course in accounting." He lowered his voice. "But then your family has money, doesn't it?" </p><p> That was one of the times Dougless's stomach had begun to hurt, and she remembered the doctor's warning about giving herself an ulcer. She had explained to Robert about her family a hundred times. Yes, her family had money -- lots of it -- but her father believed his daughters should know how to support themselves, so Dougless was on her own until she was thirty-five; then she'd inherit. She knew that if there was an emergency, her father would help her, but a pleasure trip to England hardly counted as an emergency. </p><p> "Come on, Dougless," Robert had said with a smile when Dougless didn't reply to his question. "I keep hearing what a paragon of love and support that family of yours is, so why can't they help you now?" Before she could speak, Robert raised her hand to hi...</p></p><h2>Peacock Pie</h2><p>The perfect gift for children aged 8+, this stunning classic collection of poetry will delight a new generation of readers of the Faber Children's Classics list.<br><br><i>Peacock Pie</i> contains the finest of Walter de la Mare's poems for children, accompanied by exquisite original illustrations from Edward Ardizzone.

This renaissance has primarily been stimulated by developments in PET, fMRI and other brain-scanning technology that enable scientists to pinpoint the neural correlates of conscious experience with ever-increasing accuracy. However, the study of conscious experience itself has not kept pace with these advances in third-person methodologies. If anything, the standard approaches to examining the 'view from within' involve little more than cataloging its readily accessible components. Thus the study of lived subjective experience is still at the level of Aristotelian science. This has led many to deny that there could possibly be such a thing as a truly scientific study of conscious experience, or at least to ask: can one be objective about the subjective? Drawing on a wide range of approaches &#x2015; from phenomenology to meditation &#x2015; THE VIEW FROM WITHIN examines the possibility of a disciplined approach to the study of subjective states. The focus is on the practical issues involved.</p></p><p>Francisco Varela is a cognitive scientist from LENA-CNRS, Paris and Jonathan Shear is a professor of philosophy at Virginia Commonwealth University<p>"The publication is very timely indeed. It is a splendid initiative."</p> (Dan Zahavi <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br><p>"This looks like a great book series &#x2015; a valuable extension of the Journal of Consciousness Studies. You publish a lot of things that would not be published in routine philosophical and scientific journals, and that seems to me exactly right at our present state of the investigation of consciousness. We don't know how it works and we need to try all kinds of different ideas."</p> (John Searle)<br><br><p>"Since William James, there has been remarkably little attention in the sciences of the mind to the detailed investigation of conscious experience at the personal level. THE VIEW FROM WITHIN advances such investigation along several fronts, with articles on introspection, phenomenology, and meditative psychology. Especially valuable is the editor's introduction, which provides a useful guide to the methodology of first-person accounts, and the articles that build bridges to cognitive science, psychiatry, and the scientific study of meditation techniques. Invited commentaries by leading investigators of consciousness, together with authors&#x2019; replies, make for a provocative presentation that will be discussed for some time to come."</p> (Evan Thompson)<br><br><p>"THE VIEW FROM WITHIN is a major statement, and a brilliant presentation, of the need to include first-person accounts in a science of consciousness. The editors sensibly maintain that a judicious balance of first-, second-, and third-person perspectives is not only desirable but unavoidable in any satisfactory study of consciousness. But their integrative approach is not merely a theoretical call for such; they provide instances of precisely how such a comprehensive approach can be pragmatically executed. As such, this book marks a major milestone in the science of consciousness, and it will surely become one of the standard references in the field."</p> (Ken Wilber)<br><br><p>"This is an important collection addressing what is arguably the greatest challenge now facing a science of consciousness. Such a science must connect third-person data about brain and behavior with first-person data about conscious experience. But how do we gather the first-person data, and how can we represent it? This book explores sophisticated ideas from a variety of traditions. I hope it sets the agenda for a renewed investigation of first-person methodologies and formalisms in the next few years."</p> (David Chalmers)<br><br><p>"THE VIEW FROM WITHIN provides a much needed counterbalance to the reigning trends in consciousness research. By emphasizing the importance of first person perspectives, and situating them within the context of third person accounts, one begins to see how a fully integrated research program into consciousness might develop in the future. These essays will establish an important beachhead directed towards a rich, multifaceted investigation of consciousness."</p> (Arthur Zajonc)</p><h2>The Land of Green Plums: A Novel</h2><p>Set in Romania at the height of Ceauescu's reign of terror, <i>The Land of Green Plums</i> tells the story of a group of young people who leave the impoverished province for the city in search of better prospects and camaraderie. But their hopes are ravaged, because the city, no less than the countryside, bears everywhere the mark of the dictatorship's corrosive touch. All the narrator's friends&#x2014;teachers and students of vaguely dissident allegiance&#x2014;betray her, do away with themselves, or both. As they do so, we see the way the totalitarian state comes to inhabit every human realm and how everyone, even the strongest, must either bend to the oppressors or resist them and thereby perish.<br>Herta M�ller, herself a survivor of Ceausescu's police state, speaks from intimate experience. Scene by scene, in language at once harsh and poetic, she constructs a devastating picture of a society and a generation ruined by fear. In simple images of hieroglyphic power&#x2014;policeman filling their pockets and mouths with green plums; girls sleeping with abattoir workers for bags of offal; a docile proletariat making things no one wants&#x2014;"tin sheep and wooden watermelons"&#x2014;M�ller anatomizes a country and its citizens and the corruption that has rotted the core of both.</p><p>Like the narrator of her novel <i>The Land of Green Plums</i>, Herta Muller grew up a German minority in Ceausescu's Romania, which she eventually left to settle in Germany. Her own experience lends credibility to the voice of her young narrator, who inhabits a deprived police state in which minorities such as the ethnic Germans suffer persecution beyond the quotidian oppressions of Ceausescu's regime. The title refers to the young woman's observations of the swaggering policemen who wolf down plums from the city trees, even while they're still green; the act serves as a symbol of greed, arbitrary power, and stupidity. Although an element of the story is survival, achieved by clinging to the German culture and language, the novel also confronts the older characters' sympathy with the Nazis. Nevertheless, Muller's fictional heroine finds salvation, as she herself did, in modern Germany.<p>Born in Romania in 1953, Herta M�ller lost her job as a teacher and suffered repeated threats after refusing to cooperate with Ceausescu's Secret Police. She succeeded in emigrating in 1987 and now lives in Berlin. The recipient of the European Literature Prize, she won the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award for <i>The Land of Green Plums</i>. </p></p><h2>Published in Paris: A Literary Chronicle of Paris in the 1920&#39;s and 1930&#39;s</h2><p>Profiles expatriates in Paris who were the first to publish such writers as Hemingway and Miller</p><p></p><h2>The Search for a Soul: Taylor Caldwell&#39;s Psychic Lives</h2><p>One of Jess Stearn&#39;s most dramatic and provocative explorations of the hidden dimensions of man&#39;s mind, this book delves into the psychic lives of bestselling novelist Taylor Caldwell.

At the dawn of the twentieth century, California became home to artists from all over America and Europe who aspired to depict the state&#x2019;s awe-inspiring natural landscapes on canvas. In 1909, these artists founded the California Art Club, which stands today as one of the most esteemed painting societies in the United States. The club has achieved distinction for its commitment to plein air painting, an Impressionistic style in which painters work outdoors in order to capture the ephemeral moment when the natural lighting of a landscape elevates an already beautiful scene into something sublime. Celebrating a century of unique artwork, this volume presents impeccable images of the art club&#x2019;s masterworks, including unforgettable paintings of California&#x2019;s stunning and varied beauty&#x2014;desert vistas, plunging coastlines, verdant vineyards, charming towns, and snow-topped mountains.</p><p>Jean Stern is the executive director of The Irvine Museum. An authority on California Impressionism, he coauthored California: This Golden Land of Promise and has contributed to several books about California artists.

Ching "Graphics is an inseparable part of the design process," says Francis D.K. Ching, "an important tool that provides the designer with the means not only of presenting a design proposal, but also of communicating with oneself and others in the design studio." In his newly revised and expanded Third Edition of Architectural Graphics, Mr. Ching shows the student how to use graphic tools and drafting conventions to translate architectural ideas into effective visual representation. This Third Edition expands upon the wealth of illustrations and instruction that made this title a must-have for every beginning student of architecture and design. This classic guide has a new upright format, and covers:<br> * Essential drafting principles<br> * Architectural conventions for orthographic, paraline, and perspective drawings<br> * Shade and shadow<br> * Graphic symbols and lettering<br> * Freehand sketching and diagramming<br> * Presentation layouts<br> Under the sure-handed guidance of Mr. Ching, you will develop the acute visual and manual skills that form the core of graphic communication. Here you will learn:<br> * More precise ways of using line weight variation and tonal values to show depth<br> * How to draw section views of building interiors<br> * How to construct perspectives and accurate shade and shadows<br> Clearly and beautifully, Architectural Graphics, Third Edition, demystifies the complexity of architectural concepts by presenting them in an intuitive graphic manner.Born in Hawaii, Francis D.K. Ching studied architecture at the University of Notre Dame. He began his teaching career in 1972 and is now a professor in the Architecture Department at the University of Washington in Seattle. Since VNR published the First Edition of Architectural Graphics in 1974, Mr Ching has written six more books and has gained unparalleled recognition for his unique hand-rendered drawings and book design. IN 1992 Francis D.K. Ching was awarded a Citation for Excellence in International Book Publishing.</p><h2>Einstein Lived Here</h2><p>Abraham Pais's <em>'Subtle is the Lord...'</em> is the definitive biography of Albert Einstein. Timothy Ferris, in <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>, called it "the biography of Einstein he himself would have liked best," adding that "it is a work against which future scientific biographies will be measured." As a respected physicist himself, Pais was the first biographer to give Einstein's thinking its full due, and as a close friend and associate of Einstein, he could provide an intimate, first-hand account of the life of this great scientist. The result was a national bestseller. Indeed, it was one of <em>The New York Times</em>'s Best Books of the Year, and the winner of the 1983 American Book Award for Science.<br> Now, Pais turns his attention to the great physicist's life outside of science, with an informal, almost kalaidoscopic portrait of Einstein--his personal life and his public persona ("my mythical namesake who has made my life so burdensome"), his scientific contributions, and his thoughts on religion, philosophy, and politics, on Israel and Zionism, on the rise of Nazism and McCarthyism, and on much more. Pais offers a candid look at Einstein's troubled personal life--his two failed marriages, his first child Lieserl, who was born out of wedlock (and of whom all trace has vanished), his estranged son Hans Albert, also a scientist, who felt his father had abandoned the family, and his son Eduard, who gradually descended into madness. Of course, any book on Einstein must touch upon science, and Pais includes several illuminating chapters, one of which offers general readers an accessible explanation of relativity, and another traces the long road to Einstein's Nobel Prize (after being nominated almost every year from 1909 to 1920, he finally won in 1921--not for relativity, but for his work on the photoelectric effect). On the lighter side, Pais includes samples from Einstein's "curiosity file," in which he kept crank letters, marriage proposals, hate mail (one began "You are the prince of idiocy, the count of imbecility, the duke of cretinism, the baron of morons"), and the like. But the heart of the book is the final section, where Pais traces Einstein's life as seen through the media. Here we not only meet Einstein the living legend--receiving the keys to New York City from flamboyant Mayor Jimmy Walker, attending the Hollywood premier of <em>City Lights</em> with Charlie Chaplin--but also witness his extensive involvement in the issues of his day. Much of his commentary is amazingly prescient. In 1933, he said of Nazism: "I cannot understand the passive response of the whole civilized world to this modern barbarism. Does the world not see that Hitler is aiming for war?"<br> "I can still see Einstein's smile before me," the great physicist Niels Bohr said several years after Einstein's death, "a very special smile...knowing, humane, and friendly." In <em>Einstein Lived Here</em>, this more than anything else is the Einstein we see--knowing, humane, friendly--a world figure on a par with the greats of his age who could still ask "Why is it that nobody understands me and everybody likes me."<br></p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Abraham Pais</strong> is Detlev W. Bronk Professor of Physics Emeritus at Rockefeller University in New York. He is also the author of <em>'Subtle is the Lord...'</em> (for which he won the American Book Award), <em>Inward Bound</em>, and <em>Niels Bohr's Times</em>.<br>``Why is it that nobody understands me and everybody likes me?'' Albert Einstein reportedly asked the New York Times in 1944. In this new collection of 11 essays on Einstein's life, physicist Pais responds, ``It is neither true that no one understands Einstein nor that everyone likes him.'' Pais speaks from a position of authority: He was a friend of Einstein's and wrote the highly acclaimed 1982 Einstein biography Subtle Is the Lord.... Whereas that volume focused on Einstein's scientific achievements and contained a plethora of equations incomprehensible to the layperson, this companion volume primarily illuminates Einstein's relationship with people both inside and outside the scientific community. For example, the reader catches several of Einstein's high-powered conversations with the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr about the implications of quantum mechanics, and a fleeting yet fascinating debate concerning the nature of truth with Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore. In the concluding essays Pais generally allows Einstein to recount in his own words (through excerpts from his writings, speeches, and interviews) his views on religion, philosophy, and politics. We learn how Einstein used his worldwide fame to disseminate his views on pacifism and supranationalism through the media (views that provoked anti-Semitic reactions and charges of Communist leanings from right-wingers). Along the way, Pais sheds new light on some of the controversies surrounding this intellectual giant. For instance, Pais lays to rest the claim that Einstein's first wife, Mileva Mari, played a significant creative role in the development of special relativity. Pais also explains how Einstein's scientific mind-set prevented him from accepting the indeterminate nature of quantum mechanics--even though he called it ``the most successful physical theory of our period.'' There is considerable repetition from essay to essay and despite the author's best intentions, much of the scientific discussion will lie beyond the grasp of the lay reader. Those seeking a broad overview of Einstein's life will be better served elsewhere. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It is a work of enduring value that remains essential for anyone attempting to understand the enigmatic history of the Balkan states, and the continuing friction in this fractured area of Europe.</p></p><p>Part travelogue, part history, part love letter on a thousand-page scale, Rebecca West's <i>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</i> is a genre-bending masterwork written in elegant prose. But what makes it so unlikely to be confused with any other book of history, politics, or culture--with, in fact, any other book--is its unashamed depth of feeling: think <i>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> crossed with <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>. West visited Yugoslavia for the first time in 1936. What she saw there affected her so much that she had to return--partly, she writes, because it most resembled "the country I have always seen between sleeping and waking," and partly because "it was like picking up a strand of wool that would lead me out of a labyrinth in which, to my surprise, I had found myself immured." <i>Black Lamb</i> is the chronicle of her travels, but above all it is West following that strand of wool: through countless historical digressions; through winding narratives of battles, slavery, and assassinations; through Shakespeare and Augustine and into the very heart of human frailty. <p> West wrote on the brink of World War II, when she was "already convinced of the inevitability of the second Anglo-German war." The resulting book is colored by that impending conflict, and by West's search for universals amid the complex particulars of Balkan history. In the end, she saw the region's doom--and our own--in a double infatuation with sacrifice, the "black lamb and grey falcon" of her title. It's the story of Abraham and Isaac without the last-minute reprieve: those who hate are all too ready to martyr the innocent in order to procure their own advantage, and the innocent themselves are all too eager to be martyred. To West, in 1941, "the whole world is a vast Kossovo, an abominable blood-logged plain." Unfortunately, little has happened since then to prove her wrong. <i>--Mary Park</i></p><p>'Impossible to put down, both timeless and of its time - a travel book and epic narrative history brimming with passion, anger, scholarship and intuition, hatred and love.' <i>Observer</i></p><p>First published in 1942, Rebecca West's epic masterpiece is widely regarded as the most illuminating book to have been written on what was once Yugoslavia, essential for anyone attempting to understand the enigmatic history of the Balkan states.</p><p>'Such incandescent writing - you find yourself wanting to mark every sentence in order to go back and relish it again.'

His nonfiction work includes biographies of Mussolini and Joan of Arc for A&amp;E Books. <p></p><b>Prologue</b> <p> </p><p> </p><p> <b>East Rutherford, N.J., July 15, 2002:</b> I'm sitting in the back of a stretch limo in the parking lot of Continental Airlines Arena, waiting to make my appearance on a televised wrestling show. I've been on television hundreds of times before, on hundreds of wrestling shows, but tonight is going to be different -- very different. </p><p> Tonight I'm appearing on the show I almost put out of business. And the person pulling open the car door to welcome me is the guy I almost forced into bankruptcy: Vince McMahon. </p><p> Could anyone have predicted this day would come? Never! But that's the thing about wrestling. There's a saying in our business: Never say never. </p><p> "How are you feeling?" Vince asks. </p><p> "Great." </p><p> "Nervous?" </p><p> "Not at all. Excited." </p><p> Vince looks at me for a second, like he's not quite sure he believes me. We go over what we're going to do onstage. </p><p> This is only the second time in my life that I've met Vince McMahon face to face. The first was more than a decade before, when he said hello to me after a job interview in Stamford. I didn't get the job. I didn't deserve it. </p><p> The history of pro wrestling might have been very different if I had. </p><p> The funny thing is, I feel as if I really know Vince well. We're like two soldiers back from a war; we've been through the same battles, albeit on different sides. </p><p> "Here's what I'd like you to do," Vince tells me. "When you hear me announce the new general manager of <i>Raw,</i> and you hear your music start to play -- come out, acknowledge the crowd, shake my hand, and give me a big bear hug! And milk it for all it's worth...." </p><p> He gets out of the car. Inside the arena, the crowd is hopping. They've been told <i>Raw</i> is getting a new general manager, one guaranteed to shake things up. </p><p> There's an understatement for you. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> If you're a wrestling fan, you probably know that <i>Raw</i> is World Wrestling Entertainment's flagship Monday-night television show. You probably also know that Vince McMahon is the chairman of World Wrestling Entertainment, better known as WWE. </p><p> What you may not know is that almost everything that makes <i>Raw</i> distinctive -- its two-hour live format, its backstage interview segments, above all its reality-based storylines -- was introduced first on <i>Monday Night Nitro,</i> the prime-time show I created for the TNT Network. For nearly three years, my company World Championship Wrestling, kicked Vince McMahon's ass. <i>Nitro,</i> WCW's flagship show, revolutionized wrestling. The media called our conflict the Monday Night Wars, but it was more like a rout. <i>Nitro</i> beat <i>Raw</i> in the ratings eighty-something weeks running. </p><p> Then Vince caught on to what we were doing, and the real battle began. </p><p> Unfortunately for me, and the wrestling business in general, the fight wasn't really between WCW and WWE, which was called World Wrestling Federation at the time. In fact, the real battle was between WCW and the corporate suits who took over Turner Broadcasting with the merger of Time Warner and then AOL. That was a fight I was never capable of winning, though, being stubborn by nature, I didn't realize it until it was nearly over. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Stephanie McMahon pops her head into the limo. Stephanie, Vince's daughter and one of the company's vice presidents, has come to take me in to the show. </p><p> <i>Ready?</i> she asks. </p><p> <i>I'm ready. </i></p><p><i> Nervous? </i></p><p><i> Excited.</i> </p><p> She stares at me a second, probably convinced I'm lying. I'm sure she thinks I'm a train wreck. The auditorium is packed with people who hate my guts, or I should say hate my character's guts. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Not too many people bother to distinguish between the character I play on television and who I really am. Worse, a lot of people think they know who I am because of what they've read on the Internet or in the "dirt sheets," the newsletters that cover the wrestling business for fans. </p><p> Wrestling fan sites are generally populated by people with too much time on their hands, who have very little real insight into what's going on in the wrestling business. A lot of them create their own stories and realities just to watch other people react to them. As a result of that, there's a lot of misinformation floating around out there about a lot of people, not just me. </p><p> Which is one of the reasons I decided to write this book. </p><p> The truth is, I hate most wrestling books. I read a sentence, a paragraph, sometimes a page, then quit. They don't take a serious look at the enterprise. Most are bitter, self-serving revisionist history at best -- and monuments to bullshit at their worst. A lot of the guys who write them seem desperate to have the last word on everything. Rather than telling people what we're really all about, they refight old battles that everyone but them has forgotten. They come off like whiners, complaining about everything. </p><p> That's not me. </p><p> I've had some bumps and bad breaks. Everyone does in life. But pro wrestling for me has been full of good things. I started out as a salesman and then, by necessity rather than ability, became an on-camera talent. I went from that to being chosen, improbably, to head the second largest wrestling promotion in the country. We were a distant second to Vince McMahon's company, bleeding money every year. With hard work and against heavy odds, we became number one. What had been a company generating 10 million in losses on 24 million worth of revenue, became a company with 350 million in sales pumping out over 40 million in profit. Then things went to hell. After a wild roller-coaster ride I ended up back where I had started -- as an on-air talent, ironically, with the guy I had been at war with for years. </p><p> And ultimately we became friends. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> <i>Let's go,</i> says Stephanie. <i>You're on in a few minutes.</i> </p><p> We get out of the car and begin walking through the backstage area. My appearance has been a well-kept secret until now, and the looks of shock on the wrestlers' faces as I pass confirms it. </p><p> I can hear the crowd in the arena as I reach the holding area backstage. WWE writers have given me a two-page script to memorize, and the words are bouncing in my head. The funny thing is, I've rarely had to memorize a script before -- all these years on camera, I've improvised my lines. But not tonight. The writers for WWE have spent a fair amount of time on this script; my job tonight is to deliver what they want. </p><p> But even before I look at the words, I know what I have to do tonight. I have to find my inner heel. Once I'm out there, the adrenaline will take over, and I'll be fine. </p><p> There's a hush outside. Vince McMahon has come onstage and is about to introduce me. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Wrestling began in the United States as a sideshow carnival attraction. It thrived and grew because it blended showmanship, unique characters, and illusion. It still does, in some respects. But it's also a business, and a very sophisticated one at that. The business structure and revenue model are extremely complex. No other form of entertainment, quite frankly, combines the different revenue streams and opportunities that WCW had, or that WWE has now. I hope to give you some idea of that complexity in this book. </p><p> What happened to WCW while I was there is as much about business as it is about wrestling. A lot of wrestling fans think WCW unraveled because of things like guaranteed contracts for wrestlers and the decision to give Hulk Hogan creative control over his matches. </p><p> The fact that we may have overpaid some wrestlers was one reason WCW ended up in a position that was difficult to recover from. But it had nothing to do with why WCW failed. If our talent budget was half of what it was, in the end, it would have made no difference. The company failed because of what happened inside Turner after it was bought by Time Warner. Turner's merger with Time Warner, and Time Warner's ultimate merger with AOL, was the single largest disaster in modern business history. WCW was just one of many casualties. There was a lot of collateral damage. Even Ted Turner suffered in the fallout. </p><p> Did I make mistakes? Sure. I'll list a few of the bigger ones here. But I'm tired of hearing things like, Eric Bischoff killed WCW because he overpaid wrestlers and was a Hollywood guy and so on. That's all bull. Take Eric Bischoff out of the equation, and WCW still goes down in flames, maybe even faster. </p><p> What happened to WCW is a cautionary tale. My story isn't just about wrestling and sports entertainment, but about what happens to creative enterprises and individuals when they get caught in the maul of a modern conglomerate and the short-term "meet Wall Street expectations" thinking that's so prevalent today. </p><p> I know I'm not going to convince every reader who picks this book up that what I say is the absolute truth. It's possible that I've remembered some things subjectively or have a very one-sided view of them. Plenty has been written about WCW and my time there. But none of the stories of its demise have come from someone who was there. It's been written by people who were either just making shit up or hearing rumors. I was there, on the front lines. They weren't. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> I'm on. I walk out toward the man who was my most bitter enemy for four or five years. We embrace. </p><p> <i>That rumbling beneath your feet,</i> I tell Vince, <i>is a whole lot of people turning over in their graves.</i> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2006 by World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

The office was comfortably furnished, with an oak desk and chair, a couple of four-drawer oak file cabinets, two oak side chairs and a sofa upholstered in dark green fabric sitting against one wall.<p> Oak-framed pictures of the town in the early nineteen hundreds decorated the interior and a green-glass lamp sat on the edge of her desk, giving the place a casual, old-fashioned appearance. The office was neat and orderly. With the number of cases she handled, it was imperative she be well organized.</p><p> Elizabeth glanced at the stack of manila files on her desk, each one a case she was currently working. For the past two years, she had been an employee of the small, privately owned clinic in San Pico, California. Elizabeth had been born in the town, mainly an agricultural community, situated near the southwest end of the San Joaquin Valley.</p><p> She had graduated from San Pico High, then gotten a partial scholarship to help pay her way through college. She had majored in psychology at UCLA, earning a master's in social work, making extra money with a part-time job as a waitress, as she had done in high school.</p><p> Two years ago, she had returned to her hometown, a quiet place of refuge where her father and sister lived, though her dad had died last year and her sister had married and moved away. Elizabeth had come to recover from a messy divorce, and the quiet life away from the city had helped bring her out of the depression she had suffered after her marriage to Brian Logan had fallen apart.</p><p> In contrast to the hustle of busy Santa Ana, where she had been working, San Pico was a city of around thirty thousand people, of which half the population was now Hispanic. Elizabeth's family had been among the original founders back in 1907, farmers and dairymen back then. During her childhood, her father and mother had owned a small neighborhood market, Conner's Grocery, but after her mother had died, her father had sold the business and retired, and Elizabeth had gone off to school.</p><p> She reached for the file on top of the stack on her desk, preparing herself for her upcoming session that evening with the Mendoza family, conducted in their home. The file contained a history of drinking and family violence that included an incident of child abuse, but the violence seemed to have lessened in the months the family had been in counseling.</p><p> Elizabeth fervently believed the sessions were helping family members learn to deal with each other in ways that did not include physical violence.</p><p> Leaning over the file, she tucked an annoying strand of dark auburn hair behind an ear and continued to scan the file. Like all of the Conners, she was dark-haired, slenderly built and a little taller than average. But unlike her sister, she had been blessed with the clear blue eyes of her mother.</p><p> Which meant that every time she looked in the mirror, she thought of Grace Conners and missed her.</p><p> Her mother had died a painful death from cancer when Elizabeth was just fifteen. They had been extremely close and the difficult months of caring for, then losing her had taken its toll. Elizabeth's blue eyes were her mother's legacy, but the memories they stirred were so painful that sometimes, instead of a blessing, her best feature seemed more of a curse.</p><p> Elizabeth sighed as she reached the end of the report, closed the file and leaned back in her chair. She had never expected to return to her hometown, which was flat and dusty and most of the year far too hot.</p><p> But sometimes fate had different notions and here she was, in a rented apartment on Cherry Street, doing the kind of work she had been trained for, and though she didn't particularly like living in the homely little town, at least she felt good about her job.</p><p> She was thinking about her upcoming session that night when a soft knock sounded at the door. She looked up to see one of the boys she counseled walk into the room. Raul Perez was seventeen years old, on work leave from juvenile detention, to which he'd been sentenced for the second time. Belligerent, surly and difficult, he was also smart and caring and loyal to his friends and the people he loved, and especially to his beloved sister, Maria.</p><p> His concern for others was the reason Elizabeth had agreed to do his counseling sessions without a fee. Raul had potential. He could make something of himself if he was given the right motivation -- if she could convince him that his life would never improve as long as he involved himself in alcohol and drugs.</p><p> Burglary had been the result, of course, as it often was with kids like Raul. They needed money to buy the drugs and they would do whatever it took to get them.</p><p> But Raul had been drug free for over a year and he had told her that he meant to stay that way. There was something in his intense black eyes that made Elizabeth believe it might be true.</p><p> "Raul. Come in." She smiled at him warmly. "It's good to see you."</p><p> "You are looking very well," he said, always extremely polite.</p><p> "Thank you." She thought that she did look good today, in crisp beige cotton slacks and a short-sleeved turquoise silk blouse, her shoulder-length auburn hair in loose waves around her face.</p><p> Raul sat down in one of the oak side chairs and Elizabeth sat down behind her desk. To begin the session, she started with a question about his part-time job at Sam Goodie's, janitorial and delivery work that would end when Ritchie Jenkins got back on his feet after crashing his motorcycle down at the end of Main Street. In another week, the job would be over and unless he found something else, he would be back in juvenile detention full-time.</p><p> "So, how do you like working at the store so far?"</p><p> He shrugged a pair of linebacker shoulders. "I like the music -- except when they play country western." Raul was only about five foot ten, but he was stocky and muscular, big for his age since he was a child. He had glossy, straight black hair and dark skin, marred only by the tattoo of a skull on the back of one hand and his initials in blue under the skin beneath his left ear. The initials were a homemade job probably done in grammar school. She thought the skull must have been done during his last stay in juvenile hall.</p><p> Elizabeth looked at him and smiled. "I know you'll be out of work by the end of the week, but I have some very exciting news for you."</p><p> He studied her warily from his place across the desk. "What is it?"</p><p> "You've been accepted at Teen Vision."</p><p> "Teen Vision?"</p><p> "I mentioned it a couple of weeks ago, remember?"</p><p> He nodded, his eyes fixed on her face.</p><p> "Since the farm is a fairly new facility, they only have room for twenty-five kids so far, but a couple of openings have come up and your application was one of the ones they accepted."</p><p> "I didn't put in an application," he said darkly.</p><p> She kept the smile fixed on her face. "I know you didn't -- I did. I mentioned the farm to you when you were here before. You seemed interested. I took it one step further and applied in your name."</p><p> He was frowning. That wasn't good. The students who participated in the residential program at Teen Vision were there of their own free will. If he didn't want to be involved, being there wouldn't do him the least bit of good.</p><p> "The term lasts one year. You have to be between the ages of fourteen and eighteen and you have to agree to stay the entire twelve months or they won't let you in."</p><p> "I'm out of detention for good in six more months."</p><p> "You need to change your life so that you can stay out." Raul said nothing.</p><p> "You would start next week. While you're there, your room and board would be completely taken care of. They even pay a small stipend for the work you do on the farm."</p><p> Raul grunted. "I know how much farm workers make. That's the way my family earned their living."</p><p> "This is different than being a migratory worker, Raul. You told me yourself you liked farming, being out in the fresh air working the soil. You could learn a vocation while you're there and you could get your GED. When your year is up, you could find a full-time job in agriculture or whatever you decide you want to do, something that would eventually make you a decent living."</p><p> He seemed to mull that over. "I need to think about it."</p><p> "All right. But I don't think you can make any sort of decision until you go out there, take a look at the facility and meet some of the instructors. Would you be willing to do that, Raul?"</p><p> He sat back in his chair, his eyes still on her face. "I would like to see it."</p><p> "That's great. Just remember, a place like that requires a commitment. It's a place you go in order to change your life. You have to want to do that. You have to want to start over and make a new beginning."</p><p> Raul said nothing for several long moments and neither did Elizabeth, purposely giving him time to think.</p><p> "When could we go?"</p><p> She stood up from her chair. "Do you have to work this afternoon?"</p><p> He shook his head. "Not until tomorrow morning."</p><p> "Good." Elizabeth rounded the desk and moved past him toward the door. She smiled and pulled it open. "Then why don't we go right now?"</p><p> The Teen Vision farm sat on fifteen acres of flat, arid land fronting Highway 51 a few miles out of town. It was a fertile piece of ground donated by Harcourt Farms, the largest agricultural farming company in San Pico County.</p><p> Until four years ago, Fletcher Harcourt had run the farm. After a nearly fatal accident that damaged the family patriarch's brain and left him in a wheelchair, his oldest son, Carson, had taken over the twelve-thousand acre operation. He had taken control of the company and assumed his father's once-powerful position in the community. Carson was well liked and generous. The attractive white stucco dormitory and outbuildings that housed Teen Vision had undoubtedly been funded in part by Carson's donations.</p><p> Elizabeth had met Carson Harcourt several times since her return to San Pico. He was tall, blond and attractive. At thirty-six, after several brief relationships, he remained unmarrie...</p></p><h2>Private Games (Private, 3)</h2><p><strong>On your mark<br><br></strong>Private, the world's most renowned investigation firm, has been commissioned to provide security for the 2012 Olympic Games in London.

William Heyen's recounting of America's most legendary adversarial relationship - that of Sioux leader Crazy Horse and Army General George Custer - awards pride of place to the imagination. Though informed by published histories, letters and diaries, this series of more than 450 lyric poems constitutes a "fusion of dream &amp; time," an unpredictable extrapolation of the psychological, social, and spiritual energies that led the principals and their nations to a fateful, bloody meeting on June 25, 1876. Avoiding rhetorical bombast and scholarly clutter, Heyen allows the rich imagery and tragic ironies of the West to emerge: a buffalo herd frozen to death in a canyon; the young Crazy Horse attempting to capture an eagle while cadet Custer struggles with a term paper on "the red race;" the grim, exhausting labor of extracting tens of thousands of buffalo tongues for shipment to chic Eastern restaurants; Custer's wife Elizabeth in a prairie tent, experiencing the "terror of being late, that some day/hundreds of men would have to wait/because a woman had lost her hat pins." Whether or not we believe Heyen's stated claim to psychic kinship with the spirit of Crazy Horse, his ability to maintain the reader's sense of surprise andwonder through an avalanche of poems both surreally plain ("Footnoted") and plainly surreal ("Custer in Cyberspace") is an amazing achievement in itself, enriching our sense of the past with a singular sense of the present. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>Hungry Hearts (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)</h2><p>In stories that draw heavily on her own life, Anzia Yezierska portrays the immigrant's struggle to become a "real" American, in such stories as "Yekl," "Hunger," "The Fat of the Land," and "How I Found America."

Partly motivated by a symposium held on this very topic in late 2014 at Eszterh�zy K�roly University of Applied Sciences of Eger, Hungary, the subsequent call for papers resulted in a variety of submissions. The starting point of all essays was Gloria Anzaldua&#x2019;s statement: &#x201c;[B]orderlands are not specific to the [American] Southwest. In fact the borderlands are physically present wherever two or more cultures edge each other, where people of different races occupy the same territory, where under, lower, middle and upper classes touch, where the space between two individuals shrinks with intimacy.&#x201d; As a whole the nine articles involved treat issues related to the actual U.S.&#x2013;Mexico border and U.S.-Canadian border, investigate the consequences of the encounter of different cultures, and examine the borderlines discernible in popular culture including film and music, literature, i.e. slave narratives and history.</p><p></p><h2>Est: Erhard Seminars Training: 60 Hours That Transform Your Life</h2><p>A graduate of Erhard Seminars Training combines her own recollections and evaluations with those of others in a survey of the bases, methods, and benefits of the increasingly popular human potential movement.</p><p></p><h2>enVision Algebra 2 2018 Teacher Assessment Resource Book</h2><p>Brand new, Ships from NY</p><p></p><h2>Even Cowgirls Get the Blues/My Own Private Idaho/2 Screen Plays in 1 Volume</h2><p>These two novels have both been made into films. &#34;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&#34; is an epic of cowgirls, FBI agents and ecstatic whooping. &#34;My Own Private Idaho&#34; charts the pilgrimage of a narcoleptic hustler who is searching for his long-lost mother in a world absent of love.</p><p>Gus Van Sant is fascinated by fanaticism and the isolated societies that fanatics create. <i>My Own Private Idaho</i>, loosely based on Shakespeare's <i>Henry IV</i> plays, is perhaps the most critically acclaimed of his films. <i>Even Cowgirls Get the Blues</i>, adapted from the Tom Robbins novel, did not fare well at the box office, but the version printed here is not the one seen in theatres.

The Poet is back. And he has not forgotten Rachel. He has a special present for her. Harry Bosch is adjusting to life in Las Vegas as a private investigator and a new father. He gets a call, too - from the widow of a friend who died recently. Previously in his FBI career, the friend worked on the famous case tracking the killer known as The Poet. That fact makes some of the elements of his death doubly suspicious. This novel places Michael Connelly&#39;s much-loved hero, Harry Bosch, square in the path of the most ruthless and inventive murderer he has ever encountered. It is a spectacularly dramatic and shocking novel that should take Michael Connelly to the No. 1 slot again on the Sunday Times bestseller list.</p><p>A former police reporter for the LOS ANGELES TIMES, Michael Connelly is the author of the Harry Bosch thriller series as well as several stand-alone bestsellers, including the highly acclaimed legal thriller, THE LINCOLN LAWYER, selected for the Richard &amp; Judy Book Club. Michael Connelly has been President of the Mystery Writers of America. His books have been translated into 31 languages and have won awards all over the world, including the EDGAR and ANTHONY AWARDs. He lives in Tampa, Florida, with his family.Listen up! This may be the best mystery you hear this summer--or this year, for that matter. But approach Connelly's latest with caution. If you haven't heard THE POET and BLOOD WORK, try them first. That's because this one has almost all the characters from both melded into one sequel. You'll also be able to appreciate Len Cariou's performance having had to follow that of the masterful Dick Hill. Cariou adds a new dimension to Harry Bosch. As the FBI calls back agent Rachel Walling because of the reemergence of The Poet, a serial killer, Bosch is asked to delve into the suspicious death of Terry McCaleb (the hero of BLOOD WORK). Are the two connected? There are so many subplots you can't stop thinking for a moment. Cariou deftly handles the Bosch scenes in the first person and Walling's in the third. This constant switch might have been daunting to a lesser reader. Cariou milks it for all it's worth. A.L.H.

The attack on the surveillance ship lasted 75 minutes -- 34 men died and 172 were injured. Initially it was thought that either Egypt or the U.S.S.R. was responsible, but astonishingly Israel, the U.S.'s closest ally, said that the planes and boats belonged to them, and that they mistook the ship for an Egyptian vessel -- despite the prominently displayed Stars and Stripes.</p> <p>This hard-hitting investigation shows that on that day in 1967, the world came closer to all-out nuclear war than ever before -- this incident made the Cuban Missile Crisis seem tame by comparison. Peter Hounam reveals that the attack was part of a clandestine plan between the US and Israel known as "Operation Cyanide," designed to ensure victory for Israel in the Middle East. By blaming the attack on the Arab world, retaliation on a grand scale would be justified.</p> <p>A massive cover-up has endured to this day -- the attack on the <i>Liberty</i> remains the only maritime incident that has not been investigated by Congress. But many survivors and senior government officials say that the attack was no accident, including Secretary of State at the time, Dean Rusk. Based on interviews with ex-government officers and the examination of official documents, this book answers the following questions: Why did the White House call back rescue planes from helping the <i>Liberty</i> -- twice? What was the CIA's role in this attack? Did LBJ know in advance about the attack? Why did the U.S. government accept Israel's explanation?</p> <p>This book will shock any reader interested in Middle-East affairs, as it shows that the U.S. was prepared to -sacrifice its men and risk nuclear war to ensure victory for Israel.</p></p><p>Peter Hounam was the Chief Investigative Journalist for The Sunday Times of London from 1986-1994. .

Fry?&#34;</p><p>In this collection of nine essays and a handful of unexceptional verse, Michener's best topic is himself. In "Collectors, Forgers--and a Writer" he reflects on the books, authors, and personalities that influenced him as a college student. These memories are imbued with warmth and even passion as the young Michener becomes inspired by the intelligence and eccentricities of his mentors. Michener's first short story, "Who Is Virgil T. Fry?" originally published in 1941, appears here as well with a brief self-commentary. These essays are generally compelling and skillfully crafted, although an overtone of false modesty is occasionally present (perhaps understandable for such an immensely successful writer). Also included are pieces on Margaret Mitchell and Marcus Goodrich. Michener fans and others with literary interests (even those not attracted to his epic novels) will find this volume worthwhile. For public and academic collections.<br><i>- Janice Braun, Hoover Inst., Lib., Stanford, Cal.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.All of the essays in this potpourri of literary commentary by Michener ( Tales of the South ) have been published elsewhere, and they are of uneven quality, including pieces on Ernest Hemingway, Truman Capote and Margaret Mitchell. His article on Mitchell, originally written as an introduction to an anniversary edition of Gone With the Wind , is particularly undistinguished. "Collections, Forgers--and a Writer" and "Testimony," both published previously in limited editions, deal, in part, with Michener's literary self-education and with his thoughts on effective writing; they are interesting and witty. Also included are "Who Is Virgil T. Fry?," Michener's first published short story, and several of his poems.

No aircraft fly overhead and none can land. Few ships pass this way. Just 267 people live here, earning their living from farming, fishing, conservation, handicrafts and the sale of coins and colourful postage stamps. Much of his work is involved in the conservation of some of the world&#39;s rarest species in this fragile and remote environment. It&#39;s as much about penguins as people. This is the story of the Tristan islanders, told through the policeman&#39;s notebook and the anecdotes of Conrad Glass, a former Chief Islander and Conservation Officer, who is a direct descendant of the first settler and governor, William Glass, one of a garrison landed to prevent any rescue of Napoleon from St Helena. It is the first book to be written by a Tristan islander: stories of rescue from wild Atlantic islands; volcanic eruptions; the protection of penguins, seals and albatross; of chase by a whale; escape from violent hurricanes and the keeping of the peace in this most remote of British Territories. There&#39;s a glimpse of the island&#39;s past too - hidden pirate treasure, a shipwrecked lion, ghostly apparitions, of slave ships and abduction.</p><p>Conrad Glass is a policeman with the loneliest beat in the world: he patrols the remote island of Tristan da Cunha in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean.

Applying economic analysis to the subjects of the political scientist, sociologist, and economist, Mancur Olson examines the extent to which the individuals that share a common interest find it in their individual interest to bear the costs of the organizational effort.The theory shows that most organizations produce what the economist calls &#x201c;public goods&#x201d;&#x2015;goods or services that are available to every member, whether or not he has borne any of the costs of providing them. Economists have long understood that defense, law and order were public goods that could not be marketed to individuals, and that taxation was necessary. They have not, however, taken account of the fact that private as well as governmental organizations produce public goods.The services the labor union provides for the worker it represents, or the benefits a lobby obtains for the group it represents, are public goods: they automatically go to every individual in the group, whether or not he helped bear the costs. It follows that, just as governments require compulsory taxation, many large private organizations require special (and sometimes coercive) devices to obtain the resources they need.This is not true of smaller organizations for, as this book shows, small and large organizations support themselves in entirely different ways. The theory indicates that, though small groups can act to further their interest much more easily than large ones, they will tend to devote too few resources to the satisfaction of their common interests, and that there is a surprising tendency for the &#x201c;lesser&#x201d; members of the small group to exploit the &#x201c;greater&#x201d; members by making them bear a disproportionate share of the burden of any group action.All of the theory in the book is in Chapter 1; the remaining chapters contain empirical and historical evidence of the theory&#x2019;s relevance to labor unions, pressure groups, corporations, and Marxian class action.</p><p>&#39;This superb little volume is worthy of the attention of all social scientists. it can lead to a healthy and challenging discussion and perhaps to a reappraisal of pressure groups in American society.Public Opinion Quarterly.Bryan Garsten is Professor of Political Science, Yale University.</p><h2>Guide to Southern California Backroads &amp; 4-Wheel Drive Trails</h2><p>This book is now out of print.<br><br>Please check out the updated new edition called <br>"Guide to California Backroads &amp; 4-Wheel Drive Trails" <br>The new book covers 100 of the best trails of California.

Goode Book Award, given by the Family Section of the American Sociological Association</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br><b><i>Finalist, 2019 C. Wright Mills Award, given by the Society for the Study of Social Problems</i></b></p><br><p><b>Riveting stories of how affluent, white children learn about race </b></p><p>American kids are living in a world of ongoing public debates about race, daily displays of racial injustice, and for some, an increased awareness surrounding diversity and inclusion. In this heated context, sociologist Margaret A. Hagerman zeroes in on affluent, white kids to observe how they make sense of privilege, unequal educational opportunities, and police violence. In fascinating detail, Hagerman considers the role that they and their families play in the reproduction of racism and racial inequality in America.</p><p><i>White Kids</i>, based on two years of research involving in-depth interviews with white kids and their families, is a clear-eyed and sometimes shocking account of how white kids learn about race. In doing so, this book explores questions such as, &#x201c;How do white kids learn about race when they grow up in families that do not talk openly about race or acknowledge its impact?&#x201d; and &#x201c;What about children growing up in families with parents who consider themselves to be &#x2018;anti-racist&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>Featuring the actual voices of young, affluent white kids and what they think about race, racism, inequality, and privilege, <i>White Kids</i> illuminates how white racial socialization is much more dynamic, complex, and varied than previously recognized. It is a process that stretches beyond white parents&#x2019; explicit conversations with their white children and includes not only the choices parents make about neighborhoods, schools, peer groups, extracurricular activities, and media, but also the choices made by the kids themselves. By interviewing kids who are growing up in different racial contexts&#x2015;from racially segregated to meaningfully integrated and from politically progressive to conservative&#x2015;this important book documents key differences in the outcomes of white racial socialization across families. And by observing families in their everyday lives, this book explores the extent to which white families, even those with anti-racist intentions, reproduce and reinforce the forms of inequality they say they reject.</p></p><p><b>Margaret A.Hagerman</b> is Assistant Professor of Sociology at Mississippi State University."Margaret HagermansWhite Kidsbrings to mind two words: must read....Hagerman unearths the segregation, income inequality, and racial biases which run rampant in her subjects lives... Hagermans writing is crisp and riveting...She puts forth a crucial analysis on the 'well-meaning,' 'colorblind' racism that her subjects perpetuate, stripping down the coded language of suburbia until it reveals the ugly truth underneath." (STARRED <i>Foreword Reviews</i>)<br><br>"Hagerman's book is a careful, painful and convincing argument that when white people give their children advantages, they are often disadvantaging others. Racism is so hard to overturn, in part, because white people prop it up when they work to make sure their children succeed." (<i>NBC's "Think" blog</i>)<br><br>"This innovative, absorbing ethnography reveals that there is no single way that whites learn about race. Environmental influences such as schools, neighborhoods, and even extracurricular activities profoundly shape the ways that affluent white children think about racism and its impact on people of color. Its fascinating to learn how one child develops a critique of police shootings while another insists that racism does not exist at all. This immersive study will transform the way we think about racial socialization among the privileged. White Kids is a must read for anyone interested in how racial attitudes in America take shape in their earliest moments." (Monica McDermott,Author of Working-Class White: The Making and Unmaking of Race Relations)<br><br>"[The author] examines how affluent white children think about race Hagerman spent two years immersed with 30 privileged white Midwestern families to produce this timely...study. [S]he provides revealing portraits.[and] is especially good on the &amp; conundrum of privilege.A complex and nuanced...book." (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>"More than anything else, whiteness is an everyday practice constructed out of mostly mundane, seemingly &amp; beyond race interactions. In her masterful White Kids, Margaret A. Hagerman demonstrates this fact by showing how privileged children in a Midwestern town are socialized into whiteness and, more significantly, make choices to reproduce whiteness. Hagermans book deserves to be read widely as it is a sociological gem!-Eduardo Bonilla" (Silva,Author of Racism Without Racists)<br><br>"A terrific book tracing the different trajectories of racial meaning young white children make about themselves and others as they navigate the worlds of school, friendship, and neighborhood, as well as the larger world beyond.

Practical PCT applications continue to multiply: the study of infants (Netherlands); the turnaround of troubled schools (USA, Australia), Leadership Training (USA, Canada).</p></p><p>Mr. Powers' interest in control theory began when he was a junior medical physicist at the Argonne Cancer Research Hospital in Chicago during the early 1950s. Since then he has carried on dual careers; an official one as a designer of electronic systems for science, medicine, and commerce, and an unofficial one as an explorer of the organization of living systems. <p> Now retired with his wife Mary in Durango, Colorado, he continues his work on living systems through a busy discussion group on the internet, through designing computer models of living control systems, and through meetings and conferences on his favorite subject. </p><p> He has published numerous articles in scientific and technical journals as well as authoring four books currently in print. With Richard J.

From her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902) she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs Tiggy-winkle, Mr Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten. Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood.A source of inspiration was the Lake District where she lived for the last thirty years of her life as a farmer and conservationist.Once upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes. She had eight of a family: four little girl pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck, Yock-yock and Spot; and four little boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling Bland, Chin-chin and Stumpy. Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.</p><h2>The Play Goes On: A Memoir</h2><p>The renowned American playwright reveals how, following the death of his wife, he found creative inspiration in his career and a new relationship</p><p>Despite its somber opening on the day in 1973 just after he buried his wife, Joan, this second volume of Neil Simon's memoirs is frequently as funny as his plays. The real estate agent who shows him and second wife Marsha Mason around Los Angeles reminds him so much of <i>Sunset Boulevard</i>'s Norma Desmond, he remarks, "I immediately started looking around the car for the dead monkey." When he phones his brother and says, "Danny, I just won the Pulitzer Prize" (for <i>Lost in Yonkers</i>), Danny's response is, "Wait a second, I have to stop the water in my bath." If Simon harbored any malice, some of his wry barbs might really sting. Instead, he's gentlemanly and uncontrite about the failure of his marriage to Mason ("it takes two to untangle," he opines), and even more reticent about his relationship with wife number 3 who was also number 4, which didn't work out either time. Writing plays like <i>Brighton Beach Memoirs</i> and <i>Broadway Bound</i> sparks more enthusiastic prose, and Simon's gushing about his three daughters is done in a manner so corny it's positively endearing. For a man who believes he became successful "by feeding off my own insecurities and sharing them with a world of people," Simon, at age 71, seems pretty well-adjusted. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><b>Neil Simon</b> splits his time between New York and Los Angeles.

The first part, edited by a senior Nazi who had been educated in England, is a detailed analysis of how the Germans thought the country worked. The second section is a list of the men and women the Gestapo had earmarked for immediate arrest. Written in August 1940, the handbook sheds light on the British political system, the establishment, the church, industry, the police, trade unions and even the Boy Scouts. The chapter on the British Secret Service was considered so accurate that the few copies captured at the end of the war were retained by the authorities. This translation reveals the historic document.</p><p>In August 1940, in compliance with the F�hrer�s directive on the imminent invasion of Britain, the Gestapo prepared a secret handbook to be distributed to the occupation forces. It offered an astonishing insight into exactly how the Nazis perceived Britain and her empire, offering detailed analyses of the political and economic structure of the country, with chapters covering everything from Parliament and public schools to freemasonry and the Boy Scouts. The chapter on British Intelligence was considered so embarrassingly accurate that the few copies retrieved at the end of the war were retained by the authorities.

Flanagan attended Amherst College (with a two-year hiatus to serve in the Pacific Fleet) and earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University, where he studied under Lionel Trilling while also writing stories for <i>Ellery Queen&#x2019;s Mystery Magazine</i>. In 1959, he published an important scholarly work, <i>The Irish Novelists, 1800 to 1850</i>, and the next year he moved to Berkeley, where he was to teach English and Irish literature at the University of California for many years. In 1978 he took up a post at the State University of New York at Stonybrook, from which he retired in 1996. Flanagan and his wife Jean made annual trips to Ireland, where he struck up friendships with many writers, including Benedict Kiely and Seamus Heaney, whom he in turn helped bring to the United States. His intimate knowledge of Ireland&#x2019;s history and literature also helped to inspire his trilogy of historical novels, starting with The Year of the French (1979, winner of the National Critics&#x2019; Circle award for fiction, reissued by NYRB Classics in 2004) and continuing with <i>The Tenants of Time</i> (1988) and <i>The End of the Hunt </i>(1994). He is also the author of <i>There You Are: Writings on Irish and American Literature and History</i>&nbsp;(2004).&nbsp;Flanagan was a frequent contributor to many publications, including <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>The Kenyon Review</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>Seamus Deane, formerly Professor of English and American Literature at University College, Dublin, is now Keough Professor of Irish Studies at the University of Notre Dame. Among his books are <i>Selected Poems</i>, <i>Celtic Revivals, Strange Country: Ireland and Modernity</i>, and the novel <i>Reading in the Dark</i>.

Flanagan, an American history professor of Irish descent, pulled off a substantial coup in that he brought a historian's training to bear upon a romantic moment, the period when the French landed in the west of Ireland in 1798 and all Ireland thought liberation was at hand. His research never lies around the novel in pools, it stains the entire fabric, so that when his character's point of view is emerging from a dispossessed farmer's clay hovel or a small town merchant's table in the local hotel, we smell them - their clothes, their breath and (this is Ireland after all) their politics.&#x201d; &#x2014;Frank Delaney, <i>The Guardian</i><br><br>"A masterwork of historical fiction." &#x2014;<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br><br>"The book's wide-ranging scope and erudition are reminiscent of Tolstoy." &#x2014; <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"This deserves every major literary prize." &#x2014; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;In his prodigious first novel, Thomas Flanagan grants this historic episode a new and panoramic life....[a] thoughtful, graceful elegy.&#x201d; &#x2014; Mayo Mohs, <i>Time</i><br><br>&#x201c;Such a brutal and pathetic story would alone have sufficed to make this book absorbing, but Flanagan has much more on his mind.

The boy is rescued by Mike Shannon, a Mexican War veteran riding with a "ranging company" of Texans dedicated to protecting settlers against Indian raids, and is adopted by the Shannon family. In 1861 his adoptive father is bushwhacked and murdered and the boy--now known as Rusty Shannon--follows Mike's footsteps, riding to Fort Belknap to join the Rangers. Texas is now in the throes of secession and Union sympathizers are treated as traitors. One such "traitor" is Lon Monahan, whose family befriends Rusty. Lon Monahan's particular enemy is Colonel Caleb Dawkins, a former army officer and Confederate zealot determined to conscript the Monahan boys and drive Lon and all Unionists out of Texas. When the youngest Monahan attempts to escape Texas and wait out the war, Dawkins's thugs hang him and his father. Rusty Shannon carries heavy burdens. Both of his families are dead; he is haunted by Mike Shannon's murder, thinks he knows the culprit and intends to kill the man; his new-found friends have been lynched; and his duties as a Ranger conflict with his sense of justice. And he is fated to meet again the Comanche warrior whose band killed his family and took him captive over two decades ago: Buffalo Caller.<br><br></p><p>Elmer Kelton, of San Angelo, Texas, is the most honored of all Western writers.

His most recent novels from Forge Books are The Smiling Country and Cloudy in the West.�1�<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Texas Gulf Coast, August 1840<br>&nbsp;<br>He was Comanche, and he was known among the People as Buffalo Caller. Once in a time of hunger, when he was a fledgling on one of his first hunts, the older and more experienced men had ridden their horses to exhaustion without scaring up so much as one lone, lame bull. But Buffalo Caller, riding alone, had heard a faint and distant bellow. He had responded in the voice of a buffalo, and the buffalo had answered him. The calls led him to a small herd in a hidden canyon.<br>It was not buffalo he hunted now. He scouted as a wolf for the largest assembly of raiders the Penateka band had ever put together, moving to strike the land-greedy, hair-faced American settlers of Texas. Beside him against the Texans rode Swift as the Antelope, so named for his fleetness of foot.<br>Buffalo Caller tingled with excitement over the sights he was about to behold. He had never seen an ocean or even a boat, so it strained his imagination to visualize what old men had described around their campfires. If the veterans had not let fanciful dreams overcome the realities of memory, those wonders lay no more than half a day's horseback journey ahead of him. It was claimed that the great water stretched so far one could not see all the way across. None of the People had ever ventured out upon it to determine how far it extended, for they were of the land, not of the sea. It was said that white men's boats might travel for many days without touching shore and that fish larger than horses lived in the dark and frightening depths.<br>Buffalo Caller doubted much of what he had heard. It sounded typical of the white <i>teibos</i>' lies. He had forded many rivers, and he had visited lakes wider than the rivers, but none were so wide that he could not see the opposite side.<br>Where he rode now was far to the south and east of the short-grass prairie and the limestone hill hunting grounds he was accustomed to roaming. A journey of many days had brought the massive Comanche war column into a gently rolling land of sandy soil and tall, summer-cured grass much different from the higher, drier land the Penatekas claimed as home. The hot, humid wind carried a smell foreign to his experience and left a faint suggestion of salt upon his lips. Summer heat sent sweat rolling down from beneath his buffalo-horn headdress and into his paint-streaked face, burning his eyes.<br>The foreignness of this land made him uneasy despite the persistent gnawing of curiosity. Though he wanted to see the great water for himself, he would be relieved when they finished what they came to do so they could return to country more suited to his experience.<br>What they were about was vengeance, blood for blood. In the early spring many tribal leaders and warriors had met with white chiefs in San Antonio de B�jar's council house to discuss an earlier agreement by the Comanches to free all their captives. Some had reconsidered the promise and balked, holding out for stronger terms. Talk had led to quarrel, and quarrel to the loosing of arrows and an explosion of gunfire. When the smoke drifted away, more than thirty Indians lay dead and dying in the council house and in the foul dirt of San Antonio's narrow streets.<br>In retaliation the People had killed most of the remaining white captives, but those had not bled enough to wash away the stain of the San Antonio disaster. The indignant Penatekas had undertaken this huge punitive expedition, carrying them far beyond their normal range, all the way eastward to the Gulf of Mexico. He did not know how many of the People were on this grand adventure. He had attempted to count them on his fingers and thumbs, but the task overwhelmed him. They were so many that they defied his understanding of numbers. Their horses left the grass beaten down and the ground scarred in their wake like the slow passage of a large buffalo herd. Though the object was war, many women and children had come along to watch and cheer as their warriors carried calamity to the white enemy.<br>Mexican allies guided them, for they knew the route. They knew how to pick their way through the sparsely settled region and avoid detection until time for the great force to loose its thunder and lightning. Buffalo Caller understood that the Americans had won this land from the Mexicans in a fierce war. Mexico wanted to take it back and had sent emissaries to the tribes, promising many good things in return for their aid. Buffalo Caller cared nothing for Mexico, for the first raid in which he had ridden had been against Mexicans. He had fought them often and had killed many. But he welcomed any chance to strike the Texans. A temporary alliance with a former adversary was justifiable if it promised victory over an enemy hated even more.<br>Antelope pulled up on his rawhide reins. "The wind brings the smell of smoke." He raised his head, sniffing, testing.<br>Antelope was notoriously subject to quick judgments and quick action without considering where they might lead. Buffalo Caller smelled only dust, for the ground was so dry it had cracked open in places. The soil would all be up and moving on the wind were it not bound by a heavy stand of brittle grass, the result of last spring's rains. He drew the skin taut at the edge of his right eye, trying to sharpen his vision. He decided Antelope was right, this time. "I think I see a house. It is beyond the timber, there."<br>His companion thumped the heels of his moccasins against his mount's ribs, putting him into a trot. "If they have horses, we shall take them."<br>Buffalo Caller feared that Antelope's zeal would make him forget their real mission. "Taking horses is not what you and I have been sent to do."<br>The principal concern so far had been to avoid premature detection as the army of warriors moved along. The wolves were to overtake and kill any whites who might observe their passage before the trap was sprung. That precaution seemed less important now because scouts had reported that the town of Victoria lay only a short distance ahead. The Americans would soon know of the column's coming. One Mexican guide had lived in Victoria until the Texans drove him out, and he itched for retribution. Victoria had been chosen as the first target.<br>Buffalo Caller recognized Antelope's determination. He relented, knowing Antelope would do whatever he wanted, regardless of advice to the contrary. "If we find horses, there is no reason they should not be ours". He set his dun horse into a trot that matched Antelope's pace.<br>Antelope grunted. "If we find any teibos, we will take their scalps as well as their horses." His taste for vengeance was strong. A brother's blood had soaked into the floor of the San Antonio council house.<br>"So long as we do not leave our own."<br>Emerging from a small patch of timber, they saw a man afoot in a cornfield, wielding a curved knife to cut heads from the stalks, tossing them into the bed of a wagon drawn by two horses. His back turned, he did not see the warriors' approach.<br>Antelope said, "You take the horses. I will take the man."<br>Not until he heard the hooves did the farmer turn. He wasted a long moment frozen in startled disbelief as the two Comanches rushed down upon him; then he ran for the rail fence. Antelope's arrow struck him in the middle of his back. He fell forward onto his face. The warrior leaped from his horse, vaulted over the low fence and knelt beside the dying man, slicing a patch of scalp with his knife. Buffalo Caller saw no need for undue haste. He climbed over the fence and cut the two horses loose from the wagon. They were docile. What human beings did to one another concerned them little.<br>Antelope raised the bloody trophy for Buffalo Caller to observe, then looked toward the log cabin. "There may be others."<br>Whoever was at the house might have a rifle or shotgun. Buffalo Caller saw none here. This was far from normal Comanche range, and the once-formidable Karankawas native to this region had been reduced to a pitiable scattered few. The farmer probably had seen no reason to burden himself with a weapon in the field. "We have the horses. That is what we came for."<br>Antelope insisted, "If you leave one wasp, it will rebuild the nest."<br>"But if they fire upon us, we must leave. We can do no good for anyone if we are dead." It was not that he feared death. A warrior who died in battle was promised a happy afterlife. But the life he was living here gave him pleasure, for he was yet young, and so were his two wives. He would enjoy this life as long as he could. The next would endure forever, so he was in no hurry to begin it.<br>They approached by way of the barn, larger than the cabin and built of rough boards instead of logs. His gaze was focused on the house, for if there was to be trouble it would come from there. Antelope touched his arm and pointed in silence. Beneath a roof that extended beyond the barn, a woman sat on a stool, milking a cow. Like the man, she faced away from the Indians and was unaware of them.<br>The two warriors slipped down from their horses and moved toward a log fence that separated them from the barn. Buffalo Caller climbed to the top and swung his legs over. A log cracked beneath his weight. Startled. the woman looked around, saw him, and jumped to her feet, spilling the bucket of milk. With a cry of fear, she ran to the barn door and turned, a pitchfork in her hands.<br>Buffalo Caller had never seen a pitchfork and did not know what use it was meant for, but he recognized that the sharp steel tines could pierce like a lance. She made a threatening gesture, thrusting the fork toward him. She shouted, but her words meant nothing. White people's talk was like the grunting of their stinking pigs.<br>He entertained the thought of taking her along, for his wives would welcome a slave woman to life some of labor's weight from their shoulders. Too, he had never taken a teibo woman into his blankets, and he wondered how different one might be. But she came at him with the pitchfork, and he had no choice. He fitted an arrow to the bowstring and drove it into her heart. She died quickly, with little sound and little struggle.<br>He had noticed from the first that her hair was reddish, like the hair of a buffalo calf. He knelt over her and lifted a strand of it, wondering if she might have colored it somehow. But none of the color came off on his fingers, so he decided it was natural. It would be a great curiosity when he showed it to his friends. He made a wide circle with the keen blade of his knife, wanting to keep as much of the hair as he could. He placed his foot on her back and pulled on the scalp. It tore free with a sucking sound.<br>He heard a movement in the barn and turned quickly, bringing another arrow out of the quiver. He stopped, for in the doorway stood a small boy with hair redder than his mother's Buffalo Caller could only stare.<br>Antelope spoke from behind him. "Are you frightened of a baby? I will kill him for you if you are afraid."<br>"I am not afraid, but I have never seen hair of such a color, not on a human being." He recognized that the Americans were humans, though of a lesser order. The Comanches were the real people, the True Human Beings.<br>Antelope said, "The Texans have hair of all colors." He brought out his knife and moved toward the child.<br>Buffalo Caller blocked his path. "My wives have given me only girl babies so far. I will take this boy for a son."<br>"And carry him into the fight? He will be a burden."<br>"But I can teach him to be a good hunter. He could keep us from hunger when we are old."<br>"A white-skinned Penateka with hair like fire? Who ever saw such a thing?"<br>"The buffalo will not care about the color of his hair."<br>The People had often taken Mexican children and raised them as their own. Captives helped offset the death rate caused by war and by accidents during the hunt. Since Americans had begun moving into Penateka lands, a sprinkling of lighter-skinned children had also appeared in the lodges. Most who survived the trauma of the first weeks would assimilate into the tribe. In time a majority would forget their past lives and become as Comanche-born.<br>Antelope argued, "We should kill him. The color of his hair is like blood. It could sour our medicine."<br>"What has hair to do with medicine?"<br>The boy looked in bewilderment at his mother's body. He whimpered as Buffalo Caller picked him up and tucked him under his right arm.<br>Antelope said, "I cannot tolerate a squalling child." He touched the handle of his bloodstained knife. "If he cries, I will cut his throat."<br>Buffalo Caller shifted the boy to his left arm and drew his own knife. "You will have to cut mine first." It was unthinkable that one of People might kill another, but he would inflict grievous pain with the blade if Antelope made it necessary.<br>His companion backed off. "Then do not let him cry."<br>"This one is too brave to cry. Now let us go. We do not want to miss the big fight."<br>"First I will burn the house." Antelope's eyes pinched in warning. "If you are wise, you will kill that red-haired boy."<br>Buffalo Caller tightened his hold on the youngster. "Go on. Set your fire."<br>* * *<br>Buffalo Caller had seen white-man towns before. He had visited San Antonio in his early youth, riding boldly up and down its streets, challenging any and all to come out and fight him. It was a way of demonstrating his bravery to other young men in the event any might have doubted it. No townsman had accepted the challenge face-to-face, but Buffalo Caller proudly bore the scar of a bullet would inflicted by some coward who hid inside a doorway to shoot him. When he painted himself for ceremony or battle he always made a black circle around the scar so everyone would see and know that bullets did not easily kill him. For a fighter, scars were marks of honor.<br>The column crossed a creek north of Victoria and paused while warriors took time to paint themselves and their mounts for battle. The paint carried strong medicine and helped ward off bullets. Buffalo Caller had turned his small captive over to the care of his younger wife, Whippoorwill. While women and children waited, the warriors split to make a circle around the town. Buffalo Called saw no sign that the raiders' approach had aroused alarm. That surprised him. He could only surmise that the column had been mistaken for something other than what it was. It was known that members of the Lipan tribe sometimes visited the town for friendly barter, and Mexican horse traders came occasionally with large <i>caballadas</i> to barter or sell.<br>A shout from one of the chiefs traveled quickly around the circle, picked up and relayed by other voices. The charge began with high-pitched yelling and a thunder of hoofbeats as warriors urged their horses into a run. Not until then did the town's citizens begin to realize they were under attack. The first resistance was a scattering of gunfire from buildings on the outskirts. That resistance soon mushroomed into desperate firing from the more central part of town. Warriors and horses began to falter and fall. Despite the Texans' slowness to recognize their danger, they put up a strong and costly defense.<br>Buffalo Caller brought his horse to a quick stop after a bullet passed his ear, singing like a locust, then whining off the stone wall of a house. ...</p><h2>Always in Style With Color Me Beautiful: Your Shape, Youre Style!</h2><p>Provides guidance on how to choose clothing styles and colors to complement an individual&#39;s personality and body shape</p><p>Expanding on Color Me Beautiful, Pooser here extends the seasonal color theory of dressing (depending on their skin tone, women fall into one of four categories named for the seasons: Summers and Winters look best in cool colors, Springs and Autumns should wear warmer shades) to include "flow" colorsrelated shades from all seasonal categories that can be used to accent basic colors.

I can&#x2019;t even begin to tell you how much I loved Stolen Songbird, so I had some pretty high expectations for this book and it totally delivered. The pages are full of action, mystery, romance, and a very intriguing plot!&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;&nbsp;Dark Faerie Tales<br><br>&#x201c;After having LOVED&nbsp;<em>Stolen Songbird, Hidden Huntress</em>&nbsp;had some big shoes to fill as far as expectations go. And I am happy to say that Danielle Jensen did not disappoint. Although&nbsp;<em>Hidden Huntress</em>&nbsp;was a different kind of story, it was every bit as exciting and wildly imaginative as its predecessor.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;&nbsp;The Quiet Concert<br><br>&#x201c;I loved this book so much. There were so many different elements at play that came together to make an excited, riveting, infuriating and suspenseful tale that kept me mesmerized from cover to cover.Danielle did a wonderful job of making sure all of the pieces to this story had a purpose and that they all came together seamlessly in the end. The mystery, danger, suspense, political intrigue, family ties, friendship, treachery, betrayal, power and love. It all was just so good!&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;&nbsp;A-Novel-Ty<br><br>&#x201c;<em>Hidden Huntress</em>&nbsp;was a solid second book to this series, the plot developed quite a bit and set itself up very nicely for the final book in this series.

There are so many different things that could happen in the last book and I&#x2019;m excited to find out If you&#x2019;re a fan of YA romance/fantasy, I highly recommend this series!&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;&nbsp;These Paper Hearts<br><br>&#x201c;<em>Hidden Huntress&nbsp;</em>opens up the world, simply put. It felt bigger and more encompassing, upping the ante for all involved. The pull of the story was irresistible, given how so much more now rests on the success of our protagonists. Everything that the first book set us up for comes to fruition, complete with welcome twists and unexpected surprises...that incredible ending sure has me eager for book three.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;&nbsp;The BiblioSanctum<br><br><em>&#x201c;Hidden Huntress&nbsp;</em>is suspenseful, romantic, and will have you at the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. &nbsp;If you loved&nbsp;<em>Stolen Songbird</em>, you should read this one immediately!&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;&nbsp;Books Without Any Pictures<br><br>&#x201c;I enjoyed&nbsp;<em>Hidden Huntress</em>&nbsp;immensely which delivered in every aspect as much as I expected.

You've read the #1 New York Times bestselling book based on George Lucas's masterpiece. Now, before the eagerly awaited release of Episode II, comes a stunning new Star Wars novel from one of science fiction's greatest talents, a writer universally acclaimed for his keen grasp of cutting-edge science and the brilliance of his page-turning plots: multiple Hugo- and Nebula-Award winning author Greg Bear. The result is pure adrenaline--an unforgettable journey stretching from the farthest reaches of known space to the battlefield of a young boy's heart, where a secret struggle is being waged that will decide the fate of billions.<br><br>That boy is twelve-year-old Anakin Skywalker. The Force is strong in Anakin . . . so strong that the Jedi Council, despite misgivings, entrusted the young Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi with the mission of training him to become a Jedi Knight. Obi-Wan--like his murdered master Qui-Gon-- believes Anakin may be the Chosen One, the Jedi destined to bring balance to the Force. But first Obi-Wan must help his undisciplined, idealistic apprentice, who still bears the scars of slavery, find his own balance.<br><br>Dispatched to the mysterious planet of Zonama Sekot, source of the fastest ships in the galaxy, Obi-Wan and Anakin are swept up in a swirl of deadly intrigue and betrayal. For the Trade Federation is interested in Zonama Sekot as well. Raith Sienar, a brilliant but unscrupulous weapons and ship designer, seizes the opportunity to make a killing by stealing the secret of the superfast ships. <br><br>As Sienar strikes with all the brutal power of the Trade Federation, Obi-Wan and Anakin sense a disturbance in the Force unlike any they have encountered before. It seems there are more secrets on Zonama Sekot than meet the eye.<br><br>The search for those secrets will threaten the bond between Obi-Wan and Anakin . . . and bring the troubled young apprentice face-to-face with his deepest fears--and his darkest destiny.</p><p>It's an unexpected combination: Greg Bear, author of so many ambitiously complex SF novels, writing about the colorful simplicities of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe. But he carries it off well, with a mix of action-adventure and thoughtful world building that entertains while keeping to the spirit of Lucas's saga.<p> A few years after the events of <i>The Phantom Menace</i>, young Anakin Skywalker is getting restless--sneaking away from Jedi Temple training to gamble his life in a flying game that's much more bizarre and dangerous than the movie's podracing, even before an alien Blood Carver assassin intervenes. Anakin's character is taking shape now:</p><p> </p><blockquote>But above all, he loved <i>winning</i>.</blockquote><p> To turn the boy's frustrated energy to useful ends, the Jedi Council has Obi-Wan Kenobi take Anakin to investigate the remote, enigmatic world Zonama Sekot, whose organic technologies produce magnificent spacecraft, and where a Jedi has vanished without a trace. Secretly pursuing them is a battle squadron captained by the weapons designer who has already blueprinted the Death Star and is being double-crossed by his employer Commander Tarkin.</p><p> <i>Rogue Planet</i>'s action climaxes as the Jedis learn to grow their own spaceship, the Blood Carver strikes, and two heavily armed fleets converge on helpless-seeming Zonama Sekot. Every faction has secret cards up its sleeve--and Anakin's is a very dangerous wild card indeed. There's final victory and heartbreak, but also loose ends (including even stranger, deadlier aliens) that suggest sequels to follow. Bear does a solidly workmanlike job. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Greg Bear is the author of twenty-four books, which have been translated into seventeen languages.

A former contributing editor to the Los Angeles Times Magazine, he is a senior radio producer for Homelands Productions and teaches international journalism at the University of Arizona. He lives in western Massachusetts.In the early 1970s, a unique community was founded in the los llanos region of Colombia. Located north of the Amazon rain forest, this region is an expansive savannah, sparsely populated and generally considered uninhabitable. Gaviotas originated out of the belief that the current state of urban expansion and poverty and the continued depletion of natural nonrenewable resources could not be sustained and that the future required people to learn how to live in harsh, inhospitable environments and to do so in an ecologically sound and sustainable manner. Journalist Weisman tells the story of a remarkable and diverse group of individuals (engineers, biologists, botanists, agriculturists, sociologists, musicians, artists, doctors, teachers, and students) who helped the village evolve into a very real, socially viable, and self-sufficient community for the future. The people of Gaviotas today produce innovative technologies (solar collectors, irrigation systems, windmills, and hydroponic gardens) that use the environment without depleting or destroying it. While some of their creative endeavors have not succeeded, even the failures tend to spawn ideas for future successes. Weisman does a fine job of detailing Gaviotas's evolution and placing it within the larger global historical context. The story he presents is wonderful testament to human creativity, commitment, and effort toward building a socially viable and environmentally sustainable future.?Karen Collamore Sullivan, Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), Saginaw, MI<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Across All Worlds</h2><p>Jesus Christ is not a theoretical idea or a mere concept far removed from our human experience. In Across All Worlds, Baxter Kruger brings us face to face with the fact that Jesus has established a very real and personal relationship with us in our darkness. Jesus accepts us and walks with us because he is determined that we come to know His Father with him and life in His embrace. "Baxter Kruger has seen something beautiful and he wants you to see it too. At the heart of the universe stands a set of relationships. Father, Son and Holy Spirit created you out of love to share in their love. Jesus has done everything to make this happen. Nothing is greater and nothing is better."<br> -Ken Blue, author of <i>Healing Spiritual Abuse and The Authority to Heal</i> <br> <br> "Jesus Christ is not a doctrine, but a person who knows his Father . . . Across All Worlds takes this ancient truth and reality of 'Christ in us' and breaches Western cognitive dualism to help us engage our hearts and bodies in Jesus' relationship with us."<br> -Bruce Wauchope, M.D., Adelaide, Australia <br> <br> "All that Dr. Kruger writes is rooted in the unswerving belief that the Father, Son and Spirit are not interested in some theoretically perfected humankind but rather cares deeply about each one of us here and now, in our flesh, in our daily world."<br> -David Jennings, Attorney, Vancouver, B.C. <br> <br> "For those who are compelled to 'kick at the darkness 'till it bleeds daylight,' Baxter Kruger's Across All Worlds is a steel toed boot." -?Steve Bell, Singer/Songwriter, Winnipeg, Manitoba " . . .

DeShields dedicated his Border Wars of Texas to "The Sons and Daughters of Those Noble Pioneer Fathers and Mothers who . . . battled so bravely for supremacy and . . . made possible all the glorious blessings that have followed," and herein are the accounts of the early battles of those advancing pioneers as they relentingly encroached across the borders of the territories which the Indians believed to be theirs.<br><br>DeShields' work, which used Texas' earliest historical sources such as John Henry Brown, John W. Wilbarger, and Henderson King Yoakum, is made invaluable by his extensive use of other primary source material such as his numerous turn-of-the-century interviews and correspondence with early Texas Rangers and frontiersmen who were yet living. Many of his accounts are found nowhere else in publications of Texas history and thus provide fresh insights into the history of Texas' wars against the Indians.<br><br>Despite his view of Texas history as one in which the ultimate victory of the dauntless Anglo pioneer over the savage Indian was both predetermined and inevitable, DeShields' work retains a humanistic viewpoint, supporting Houston's conciliatory Indian policies of total destruction or expulsion. Regardless of DeShields' personal sympathies, the conflicts between the pioneer and Indian warring factions were bloody and savage, and DeShields superbly documents the savagery.</p><p>JAMES T. DESHIELDS (1861&#x2013;1948) grew up in Bell County, Texas, during a period when many frontier conditions still prevailed. At Salado College and Baylor University he began his extensive collection of manuscripts, books, and paintings of Texas history.

These prepare the reader for the introduction to higher-order exterior differential forms added to Chapter 3. Also found now in Chapter 3 are a new proof of the implicit function theorem by successive approximations and a discus� sion of numbers of critical points and of indices of vector fields in two dimensions. Extensive additions were made to the fundamental properties of multiple integrals in Chapters 4 and 5. Here one is faced with a familiar difficulty: integrals over a manifold M, defined easily enough by subdividing M into convenient pieces, must be shown to be inde� pendent of the particular subdivision. This is resolved by the sys� tematic use of the family of Jordan measurable sets with its finite intersection property and of partitions of unity. In order to minimize topological complications, only manifolds imbedded smoothly into Euclidean space are considered. The notion of &#34;orientation&#34; of a manifold is studied in the detail needed for the discussion of integrals of exterior differential forms and of their additivity properties. On this basis, proofs are given for the divergence theorem and for Stokes&#39;s theorem in n dimensions. To the section on Fourier integrals in Chapter 4 there has been added a discussion of Parseval&#39;s identity and of multiple Fourier integrals.</p><p></p><h2>The Seven Seasons of a Man&#39;s Life: Examining the Unique Challenges Men Face</h2><p>In Patrick Morley&#39;s true sequel to The Man in the Mirror a man is taken beyond the day-to-day problems he faces and is confronted with seven major seasons of life that can make him or break him. The softcover edition includes a leader&#39;s guide for small groups.</p><p>Now in softcover--Patrick Morley&#39;s powerful and uplifting insights into the passages of manhood In his phenomenally successful first book, The Man in the Mirror, award-winning author Patrick Morley took men for a close-up on crucial aspects of their manhood and challenged them to establish wise priorities in life. In his ensuing book, The Seven Seasons of a Man&#39;s Life, Morley shifts the perspective to wide-angle. Looking at the broad sweep of life itself, he gives men a view of its landscape that can help them determine where they are, where they&#39;re headed, and how to get there. While writing this book I have constantly asked myself, What can I offer you that has cost me a great price?&#39; says Morley to his readers. With that in mind, he presents his hard-won perspectives on the seven seasons of Reflection, Building, Crisis, Renewal, Rebuilding, Suffering, and Success--and in so doing, addresses men&#39;s deep longing for direction and purpose. In chapters such as . . . Wounded Warriors: Men Under Pressure Building a Career Building Our Families and Wives Burnout Defining Moments Restoring Relationships Three Private Spiritual Disciplines Four Consoling Truths About Suffering The Four Attitudes of Successful Men . . . Morley details with candor, simplicity, and passion the issues every man must face. He illustrates them with stories from his own life and the lives of other modern-day men. And he presents meaty questions for men to chew on and decisions for them to act upon. For men who want to move beyond their weakness and fear to the expectation and hope of a life fully committed to Christ--who want to make their lives count for something bigger and more lasting than themselves--The Seven Seasons of a Man&#39;s Life will strike a deep, resounding chord. Complete with a leader&#39;s guide for those who want to conduct a small-group study, this penetrating and richly encouraging book will help men turn from empty pursuits and vain conquests to the joy, passion, and eternal satisfaction of manhood&#39;s highest purpose.Patrick Morley is a business leader, a speaker, and the best-selling author of seven books, including The Man in the Mirror, Walking with Christ in the Details of Life, The Rest of Your Life, and Devotions for Couples.

Now, at last, the man himself tells us the story of life in the crossfire hurricane. And what a life. Listening obsessively to Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records as a child in post-war Kent. Learning guitar and forming a band with Mick Jagger and Brian Jones. The Rolling Stones&#39; first fame and success as a bad-boy band. The notorious Redlands drug bust and subsequent series of confrontations with a nervous establishment that led to his enduring image as outlaw and folk hero. Creating immortal riffs such as the ones in &#39;Jumping Jack Flash&#39; and &#39;Street Fighting Man&#39; and &#39;Honky Tonk Women&#39;. Falling in love with Anita Pallenberg and the death of Brian Jones. Tax exile in France, wildfire tours of the US, &#39;Exile on Main Street&#39; and &#39;Some Girls&#39;. Ever increasing fame, isolation and addiction. Falling in love with Patti Hansen. Estrangement from Mick Jagger and subsequent reconciliation. Solo albums and performances with his band the Xpensive Winos. Marriage, family and the road that goes on for ever. In a voice that is uniquely and intimately his own, with the disarming honesty that has always been his trademark, Keith Richards brings us the essential life story of our times.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2010</strong>: It's hard to imagine a celebrity memoir--or any memoir for that matter--that is as easy to drink in (so to speak) as Keith Richards's <i>Life</i>. Die-hard Stones fans will love tales of the band's ascension from the "interval" band at the Marquee to the headliners at Super Bowl XL; guitar gearheads will scramble to sample the one lick that has eluded Richards for 49 years; and historians and romantics alike will swoon over the raspy, rambling, raucous detail of this portrait of the artist <i>in situ</i>. Yes, some tales are told, but <i>Life</i> is refreshingly not gossipy, mean-spirited, or sordid--or at least not more than the truth demands. Richards is as comfortable in his bones as a worn pair of boots, and <i>Life</i> captures the rhythm of his voice so effortlessly that reading his tale is like sharing a pint with an old friend--one who happens to be one of the most iconic guitarists of all time. <em>--Daphne Durham</em>Born in Dartford in Kent in December 1943, Keith Richards continues to compose, play songs and tour with the Rolling Stones.</p><h2>Luscher Color Test</h2><p>The principle of the Luscher Color Test is that accurate psychological information can be gained about a person through his choices and rejections of colors. A simplified version of the test may be taken and interpreted quickly, and the layman can administer it to himself, even before reading this book. In fact, it is advisable that he do so: reading the text beforehand might prejudice his color selections. By simply following the instructions on pages I, II, and III, which explain how to use the eight bound-in color cards and the Interpretation Tables, the reader will find how psychologically revealing color choices can be. IMPORTANT The Luscher Color Test, despite the ease and speed with which it can be administered, is a &#34;deep&#34; psychological test, developed for the use of psychiatrists, psychologists, physicians and those who are professionally involved with the conscious and unconscious characteristics and motivations of others. It is NOT a parlor game, and most emphatically it is not a weapon to be used in a general contest of &#34;one-upmanship.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Space Vampires</h2><p>1st edition Panther 1977 vg In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>British author of THE OUTSIDER and many other books</p><h2>Personality: The art of being and becoming (The Collected works of Hazrat Inayat Khan)</h2><p>Development of the personality and a natural mode of life through training of the ego, tuning the heart, and developing will power.</p><p>Hazrat Inayat Kahn, founder of the Sufi order in the West, was born in India in 1882.

Crowded with characters, both human and non-human, and bursting with action, <i>The Odyssey</i> details the adventures of Odysseus, king of Ithaca and hero of the Trojan War, as he struggles to return to his home and his waiting, ever-faithful wife, Penelope.<p>Along the way he encounters the seductive Circe, who changes men into swine; the gorgeous water-nymph, Calypso, who keeps him a prisoner of love&#x201d; for seven years; the terrible, one-eyed, man-eating giant Cyclops; and a host of other ogres, wizards, sirens, and gods. But when he finally reaches Ithaca after ten years of travel, his trials have only begun. There he must battle the scheming noblemen who, thinking him dead, have demanded that Penelope choose one of them to be her new husband and Ithaca&#x2019;s new king.</p><p>Often called the second work of Western literature&#x201d; (The Iliad, also by Homer, being the first), <i>The Odyssey</i> is not only a rousing adventure drama, but also a profound meditation on courage, loyalty, family, fate, and undying love. More than three thousand years old, it was the first story to delineate carefully and exhaustively a single character arc a narrative structure that serves as the foundation and heart of the modern novel. Robert Squillace&#x2019;s revision of George Herbert Palmer&#x2019;s classic prose translation captures the drama and vitality of adventure, while remaining true to the original Homeric language.</p><p><b>Robert Squillace</b> teaches in the Cultural Foundations division of New York University&#x2019;s General Studies Program.

Their escape attempt only lands them deeper in the guts of this prison for young offenders, and then into solitary confinement. And that's where a whole new struggle begins&#x2015;a struggle not to let the hellish conditions overwhelm them. Because before another escape attempt is even possible, they must first survive the nightmare that now haunts their endless nights.</p></p><p><p><b>Alexander Gordon Smith</b> is the author of the <i>Escape from Furnace</i> series, including <i>Lockdown</i>. Born in 1979 in Norwich, England, he always wanted to be a writer. After experimenting in the service and retail trades for a few years, Smith decided to go to University. He studied English and American Literature at the University of East Anglia, and it was here that he first explored his love of publishing. Along with poet Luke Wright, he founded Egg Box Publishing, a groundbreaking magazine and press that promotes talented new authors. He also started writing literally hundreds of articles, short stories and books ranging from <i>Scooby Doo</i> comic strips to world atlases, <i>Midsomer Murders</i> to <i>X-Files</i>. The research for these projects led to countless book ideas germinating in his head. His first book, <i>The Inventors</i>, written with his nine-year-old brother Jamie, was published in the U.K. in 2007.

I didn&#x2019;t stop there; I couldn&#x2019;t. I stole from the people I loved, and took the things that meant the most to them. I didn&#x2019;t just break into their cupboards and drawers, I broke into their hearts and ripped out whatever I wanted, anything that would get me some easy money down at the market.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So don&#x2019;t go fooling yourself that I&#x2019;m a good person, that I&#x2019;m an innocent victim, someone who didn&#x2019;t deserve to be locked up inside the hell on earth known as Furnace Penitentiary. I&#x2019;m not. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong: I didn&#x2019;t kill my best friend Toby when we broke into that house. No, the blacksuits did it, they shot him then they framed me for his murder. But I&#x2019;ve done things that are just as bad. I&#x2019;ve killed little parts of people; I&#x2019;ve cut them up inside, hurt them so much they wished they were dead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There isn&#x2019;t time to confess everything, but I have to get this off my chest. If I don&#x2019;t do it now then I might never get the chance. Death&#x2019;s coming up fast. I can feel its cold fingers around my throat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two years ago, when I was twelve, my gran died&#x2014;had a fit in the middle of the night and swallowed her tongue. Mom was devastated, like any daughter would be. She cried for weeks, she didn&#x2019;t eat, she hardly spoke to me or Dad. She&#x2019;d just sit and hold the little silver locket that Gran had left her, gently stroking the scarred and crumpled photos inside.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess I don&#x2019;t really need to tell you what I did. But I&#x2019;m going to anyway. <i>I need to.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I waited till she was asleep one night, ten days or so after Gran had been buried. Then I sneaked into her room and pried that locket from her hand. Ten quid. Ten lousy quid is what I got for it. A handful of dirty coins for the only thing my mom had left of her mom. I watched the man I&#x2019;d sold it to rip the photos out from inside and chuck them in the bin, and I didn&#x2019;t feel a shred of remorse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mom knew I was the one who&#x2019;d taken it. She never said anything but I could see it in her eyes. There was no warmth there anymore, no love. It was like she looked right through me, at a phantom over my shoulder, at the son she wished she could have, the son she&#x2019;d lost forever.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See what I mean? I&#x2019;m not a good person. Don&#x2019;t forget that. It&#x2019;ll make my story easier to stomach if you know that I deserved to be punished for Toby&#x2019;s death, even though it wasn&#x2019;t me who pulled the trigger&#x2014;that I deserved to be sent away for life in Furnace, deep in the rancid guts of the planet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that I deserved everything that happened to me there. Because Furnace is no ordinary prison, it&#x2019;s a living nightmare perfectly designed for people like me. A place where freaks in gas masks&#x2014;wheezers, as we called them&#x2014;stalk the corridors at night and carry boys screaming from their cells. Where those stolen kids are brought back as monsters, all rippling muscles beneath stitched skin. And where the same poor wretches are eventually turned into blacksuits, the warden&#x2019;s soulless guards.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw it happen with my own eyes. I saw it happen to Monty. I saw what he&#x2019;d become, right before he died.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, never let yourself forget that I&#x2019;m a bad person, that all us cons are, even the &#x201c;good guys&#x201d; I met inside like Donovan and Zee and Toby (no, not my old friend I&#x2019;m supposed to have killed&#x2014;a new friend with the same name). The four of us thought we&#x2019;d found a way to escape, blowing a hole in the chipping room floor with gas smuggled out of the kitchen. But nobody can run from their own demons. Donovan was taken by the wheezers the night before we broke, and as for the rest of us&#x2014;me and Zee and my new friend Toby&#x2014;well, maybe even Furnace was too good for us. It was certainly too good for Gary Owens, the hard-case headcase who discovered our plan and followed along like a bad smell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, maybe our fate was to find out what horrors lay in the tunnels <i>beneath</i> the prison.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because that was our way out: the river that runs deep underground below the bowels of Furnace. We didn&#x2019;t know where it led to. We didn&#x2019;t care. Anywhere that wasn&#x2019;t Furnace was good enough for us.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or so we thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh yes, beneath heaven is hell, and beneath hell is Furnace. But the horrors that crawl and feast beneath <i>that</i>&#x2014;now that&#x2019;s a truly fitting punishment for someone like me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there you have it, my confession. It may not seem like the best time to share it, but it&#x2019;s funny what races through your head when you&#x2019;re plummeting into the darkness with only razor-sharp rocks and rapids to break your fall.<br><br>Excerpted from <i>Solitary: Escape from Furnace 2 </i>by Alexander Gordon Smith.<br>Copyright � 2009 by Alexander Gordon Smith.<br>Published in 2009 by Farrar Straus Giroux.<br>All rights reserved.

Late morning, early evening: I could not judge. I stood on the crest of a low hill, between thick black trunks smooth as glass. Behind me, a dense enclosure of more black trunks. And ahead...detail rushed upon me; I sucked it in with frantic need.<br>Red and purple forest pushed over low boxy hills, fading to pink and lavender as the hills receded toward the horizon. Mist curled languidly between. Immense trees like the skeletons of cathedral towers punctuated the forest every few hundred meters, pink crowns perched atop four slender vaulting legs, rising high over the rest of the forest. Above the hills, sky beckoned crystal blue with mottled patches of more red and purple, as if reflecting the forest. In fact, the forest inhabited the sky: tethered gas-filled balloons ascended from the distant stands of black-trunked trees into thin shredded-ribbon clouds.<br>Everything glowed with serene yellow light and brilliant blood-hued life. Everything, related. For as far as the eye could see--what Darrow Jan Fima had called Elizabeth&#x2019;s Zone, one creature, one <em>thing</em>.<br>From where I stood, at the top of a rise overlooking the broad, dark olive Terra Nova River, Lamarckia hardly seemed <em>violated</em>. Not a human in sight, not a curl of smoke or rise of structure. Somewhere below, hidden in the tangle of smooth black trunks, huge round leaves, and purple fans, the ferry landing was supposed to be...And inland a few hundred meters along a dirt and gravel path, both hidden in the dense pack, the village of Moonrise.<br>I touched my clothes self-consciously. How out-of-place would I look?<br>I realized I had been holding my breath. I inhaled deeply. It was a sweet and startling breath. The air smelled of fresh water, grapes, tea leaves, and a variety of odors I can only describe as skunky-sweet. Rich aromas wafted from nearby extrusions resembling broad purple flowers, with fleshy centers. They smelled like bananas, spicy as cinnamon. The extrusions opened and closed, twitching at the end of each cycle. Then they withdrew altogether with thin, high chirps.<br>I reached out my hand to stroke the smooth black curve of a trunk. At my touch, the bark parted to form a kind of stoma, red and pink pulp within. A drop of translucent white fluid oozed from the gash, which quickly closed when I lifted my hand.<br>&#x201c;Not a tree,&#x201c; I murmured. The Dalgesh report--by the original surveyors--had called them &#x201c;arborid scions.&#x201d; And this was not a forest, but a <em>silva</em>.<br>There were no plants or animals as such on Lamarckia. The first surveyors, in the single day they had spent on the planet, had determined that within certain zones, all apparently individual organisms, called scions, in fact belonged to a larger organism, which they had called an ecos. No scion could breed by itself; they did not act alone. An ecos was a single genetic organism, creating within itself all the diverse parts of an ecosystem, spread over large areas--in some cases, dominating entire continents.<br>Each ecos was ruled, the surveyors had theorized, by what they called a seed mistress, or queen. Neither the surveyors--nor the immigrants, according to Jan Fima--had ever seen such a queen, however; understanding of Lamarckian biology and planetary science in general had still been primitive among the immigrants when the informer left.<br>Above, the black trunks spread great round parasol-leaves, broad as outstretched arms, powdery gray at their perimeters, rose and bloodred in their centers. The parasols rubbed edges in a canopy-clinging current of air, making a gentle shushing noise, like a mother calming an infant. Black granular dust fell in thin drifts on my head; not pollen, certainly not ash. I rubbed some between my fingers, smelled it, but did not taste.<br>The last light of the orange sun warmed my face. So this was not morning but evening; the day was ending. I savored the glow. It felt wonderfully, thrillingly familiar; but it was the first sunlight I had ever directly experienced. Until now, I had spent my whole life within Thistledown and the Way.<br>My terror passed into numb ecstasy. The sense of alien newness, of unfamiliar beauty, hit me like a drug; I was actually walking on a <em>planet</em>, a world like Earth, not within a hollowed-out rock.<br>Reluctantly, I turned from the sun&#x2019;s warmth and walked in shadow down an overgrown trail. If I had come out in the right place, this trail would lead to the Terra Nova River and the landing that served the village of Moonrise. Here, I had been told, I might catch a riverboat and travel to Calcutta, the largest town on the continent of Elizabeth&#x2019;s Land.<br>I wondered what sort of people I would meet. I imagined feral wretches, barely social, clustered in dark little towns, immersed in their own superstitions. Then I regretted the thought. Perhaps I had spent too much time among the Geshels, having so little respect for my own kind. But of course Lenk&#x2019;s people had gone beyond my own kind. Yanosh had characterized them as fanatic.<br>The moist air of the river valley sighed around me, like an invisible chilly flood. Picking my footsteps carefully, avoiding lines of finger-sized orange worms topped by feathery blue crests, I listened for any sounds, heard only the rubbed-silk hiss of air and the liquid mumble of the river.<br>The trail at least had once been traveled by humans. Dropped between the trunks, in a tangle of stone-hard &#x201c;roots,&#x201c; I spotted a small scrap of crumpled plastic and knelt to pick it up. Spread open by my fingers, it was a blank page from an erasable notebook.<br>At least, I realized with considerably relief, I had not arrived <em>before</em>the human intruders. That would have meant I was truly trapped here, with no chance of returning until they arrived...Or someone came from the Hexamon to get me.<br>I pocketed the scrap. I still could not be sure how much time had passed since the arrival of Lenk and his followers.<br>Four thousand one hundred and fourteen illegal immigrants; as much as three decades between my arrival and theirs. What could they have done to Lamarckia in that time?<br>I pushed through a tangle of purple helixed blades. My feet sank into a grainy, boggy humus littered with pink shells and pebbles. No landing visible; no lights, no sign of river traffic. For a moment, I knelt and dug my fingers into the soil. It felt gritty and resilient at once--grains of sand and spongy corklike cubes half a centimeter on a side, suspended in inky fluid that globbed immiscibly amid drops of clear water. It looked for all the world like gardener&#x2019;s potting soil mixed with viscous ink.<br>I picked up a pink shell. Spiral, flat, like an ancient Earth ammonite, four or five centimeters across. I sniffed it; clean and sweet, with a watery, dusty smell backed by a ghost of roses and bananas. I poked it with a finger; it crushed easily.<br>More black powder fell in thin curtains nearby. I glanced up and saw what looked like an immense reddish-brown snake, banded with deep midnight blue, dozens of meters long and as thick across as my own body, twisted around and draped across the trunks and leaves above. It wriggled slowly, peristaltically. I could see neither its head nor its tail. With a clamping sensation in my throat and chest, I trotted down the trail, trying to get out from under the serpent.<br>The trail became thicker, overgrown by smaller red and purple plantlike forms, <em>phytids</em>, filling in between the arborids. I lost my way and had to listen for the sound of the river to orient myself.<br>Several minutes passed before I realized I was smelling something out of place, rich and gassy. During my walk, I had not once smelled mold or methane, not once felt the squelch of dead vegetation. Plants, trees--convenient words only--grew from soil that might have been prepared by diligent and cleanly gardeners. Only the pink shells, mired in the mud, gave a hint that anything here lived, then died, and in dying, left remains--<br>And this fresh scent of decay.<br>I thrashed down to the bank again and stared over the deep brownish water to the black silhouette of the opposite shore. Faint, broad patches of blue glow sprang up between the trees across the river. They sputtered and went out again. I could not be sure I had seen them. Then, high above, the undersides of the broad parasols flashed blue. Somewhere, high-pitched tuneless whistling. A flutter beneath the parasols: dark winged things carrying fibrous scraps. Something small and red darted past my face with an audible sniff.<br>The wind died. The night air sank. Fog danced and twisted in the middle of the river. With the silence came another whiff of decay. Animal flesh, rotting. I was sure of that much.<br>I followed the scent Back up the bank, stepping gingerly over writhing purple creepers, guided by faint blue flashes through the undergrowth, I found the remains of the trail.<br>Something made a sound between a squeak and a sigh and scuttled on three legs out of the undergrowth: a pasty white creature the size of a small dog, triangular in shape. It stood by a black trunk and regarded me through patient, empty eye-spots mounted along a red central line. It pulsed and made tiny whistling sounds. Its skin crawled in what I took to be disgust at my presence. But apparently disgust was only disapproval--or something else entirely--for it did not retreat. Instead, it slowly clasped and crawled its way up a trunk, opened a stoma with a tap of its pointed tail-foot, and began to suck milky fluid. I watched in fascination as its white body swelled. Then, half again as large as before, the creature dropped from the trunk, landed in the dirt with a rubbery plop, and crabbed away with a half circling gait on the down-bent points of its triangle.<br>Twilight was quickly obscuring everything. A double oxbow of stars pricked through the thin clouds. Ahead, a flickering orange light drew my attention: a torch or flame.

It is a tale of men and women on a frontier so vast that they seem eclipsed by it. It is the story of their survival and their despair and sometimes their triumph. It is a record of scientists who seek understanding of the natural world and of Native Americans who are losing that world, as their age-old culture and their cosmos disintegrates.<br> For thirty years I have conducted ecological studies in the Brazilian Amazon, in particular around the remote headwaters of the Rio Juru�, in the state of Acre, near the Peruvian border. In the course of my journeys there, I have become friends with indeed, part of the extended family of the pioneers along the rivers and highways. A wanderer from another continent, I have shared their lives and for a moment was captivated.<br> I lived among four cultures: the recently arrived colonists from Brazil&#x2019;s densely populated east who have settled along the Transamazon Highway; the Caboclos, people of mixed heritage who are masters at making a living along the rivers in this intractable land; the local Native Americans; and the university-trained scholars of the Western empirical scientific tradition.<br> The colonists settle along the moth-eaten edge of the highway the Transamazonica growing manioc and coffee and raising a few pigs and chickens in the sandy soils. Some bring the inappropriate farming technologies of Brazil&#x2019;s arid east to the tropical rainforest; or, worse, some are city folk with no understanding of farming or the soil. The colonists inevitably fail; the forest succumbs to ephemeral small fires; its fertility is transient.<br> The Caboclos are fiercely defensive of their lonely environment. Of African, European, even Middle Eastern descent the vestiges of past diasporas they are mostly Native American. They all speak Portuguese now. Although most have lost their native languages, they have not necessarily lost all their native skills. They know how to eke out a living in the river and forest. Still, they are not masters of their environment. They are seduced by the forces of commerce, especially by rubber-tapping and cattle- ranching.<br> The Native Americans, who once understood every nuance of this forest and had a name for every one of its species, have become dislocated and confused, coveting Western ways but unable to grasp them. In a generation many will become Caboclos themselves, but in the quantum jump from Native American to Caboclo they will lose their traditions, their culture, and their very language.<br> Each family along the rivers has its own tale, often tragic, sometimes heroic. The best interests of the different groups are often in conflict in a land where there is no law, a land neglected by an indifferent government hundreds of miles away. As in the North American West of more than a century and a half ago, conflicts in western Acre today are settled by gunfights and knives; feuds endure for generations.<br><br>I came to the River for science to explore one of the great and enduring conundrums of nature: how can so many species coexist in such a small patch of this earthly orb? My colleagues and I try to decipher how ecosystems evolve and are maintained. I suppose, in retrospect, that my particular discipline, botany, was irrelevant. I could just as easily have been an entomologist or an ichthyologist. In any case, this lonely terrain would have seduced me into returning again and again. For me, what was important was to bear witness to this place that is like no other, to be a player in the game of science, and to have a dalliance with knowing aware all the while that the paradigms of today will be supplanted by better ideas tomorrow.<br> How privileged I was to experience this place at this moment in history. Had I made this journey 150 years ago, the vistas and ways of life would have been the same, although my tale would have had more danger. As I do today, I would have reveled in the dumbfounding diversity of life forms. Unlike today, however, then I could have done little more than pose questions.<br> One might imagine that it&#x2019;s a simple goal to understand the way things are assembled on this planet, the rules of order. Yet the measurement of patterns of species abundance and rarity and the slow realization that this diversity was generated not by a benign and constant environment but by distuurbance and inconstancy has been one of the great intellectual quests of our time. How many species can evolve in a small space and be held there? What are those species? Can we ever count them all, describe them? Are they all variations on a limited number ooooof themes, or are they a richly diverse m�lange? Why are there any rare species at all? Why haven&#x2019;t the most successful species pushed aside the others?<br> The field work necessary to answer these questions is laborious: every tree and shrub on each small plot must be collected, identified, and mapped. The task is all the more difficult because many of the species in the area I study are new to science, or have been described only in an arcane monograph in a specialized library. I now have data from a total of 18 hectares. A hectare is an area of only 100 by 100 meters, and 18 hectares is just a mote in the vast Amazon Valley.<br>But that small area seems a universe to me. Its diversity is stunning: more than 20,000 individual trees belonging to about 2,000 species three times as many tree species as there are in all of North America. And each tree is an ecosystem unto itself, bearing fungi, lichens, mosses, ferns, aerophytes, orchids, lianas, reptiles, mammals, birds, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, mites, and uncountable legions of insects. The number of insect species alone especially of beetles may exceed the combined total of all the other species of plants and animals in the forest.<br> From repeated observation and from the patient teaching of the Native Americans and the Caboclos, I have learned to regard each tree on my study sites as an individual: I know its indigenous name, the lore that surrounds it, the medicines that can be made from it, its uses for food or fiber, and myriad other arcane items of its natural history. I know its hitchhikers, the traplining bees that are its pollinators, the bats that disperse its seeds, its parasites, and the lianas that steal its light. I know how the sap smells and feels; how the ocelots have raked its bark and scent-marked it with their urine. I know the generations of pacas that live under its flying buttresses, the army ants that bivouac every few years in its hollow trunk, the tinamou that forlornly flutes from its highest bough. I&#x2019;ve observed its seasons of poverty, when the land is unyielding and sparse, and of productivity, when the red-footed tortoises and white-lipped peccaries eat its fruits.<br>The story of each tree is a story of seasons of birth and death, a story as old as Earth herself.<br> To walk through the forest for a day or even a month is like taking a snapshot of a child and expecting to know what she will look like as an adult or how she appeared as a baby. And so I returned each year to my little patches of forest to learn the destinies of the trees I had so meticulously measured five, ten, or twenty years before. Had they survived? How much had they grown? Were the diversity and species composition of the forest changing? These simple questions, so basic to our understanding of pattern and process, had no obvious answers. I learned that a tropical forest cannot be measured in only three dimensions.<br>Time the inscrutable fourth dimension that we measure with clanking mechanical wheels or the vibrations of molecules is the key to understanding how a tropical forest was wrought, how its diversity is maintained, and what it will become. When I first visited the Amazon, the trees seemed to be immortal; by comparison my life seemed as transient as an ant&#x2019;s.<br>But I learned that the vast majority of the trees in my forest plots died as seeds or sproutlings, and a sapling was lucky to live to reproductive age. Some trees were broken by tipsy neighbors or suffocated in the lethal shade of the light-greedy canopy; then their minerals were recycled into new recruits. Today these trees exist only as numbers in my data book. Only a few saplings had the good fortune to sprout in a light gap created by the death of a neighbor, allowing them to invest in a trunk and the woody infrastructure necessary to lurch into the canopy, stake a claim, and win a place in the sun.<br>These few will become the giants that spread their boughs and cast their seeds over all the others, and I&#x2019;m sure they will stand long after I have vanished.<br> The more I explore the rainforest, the more questions I have and the more ignorant I feel. This, of course, is the signature of good science. True, I have identified and mapped every tree and shrub in some small nooks and corners of this vast forest. I understand these microcosms. But my research is constrained by its small scale, which doesn&#x2019;t reveal the whole any more than a rain puddle is representative of a summer pond full of living things.<br><br>In 1974 I was a member of the first team of botanists to collect plants along the brand-new road being constructed between Manaus and Porto Velho, part of the Transamazon Highway system. The road, intended as a sinew of commerce, was the portal for my entry into the forest, into places that had been inaccessible until then. The highway ran straight through the forest, indifferent to rivers and terrain, across highland and floodplain. At first Brazil&#x2019;s military government kept the settlers and squatters at bay, and for a while the trees grew right...</p><h2>Woodland Christmas</h2><p>Presents a menagerie of forest creatures preparing for the holidays, including badgers, beavers, pigs, and ducks, and features an Advent calendar</p><p></p><h2>Chinese System Of Natural Cures</h2><p>Discover traditional Chinese herbal healing formulas--and how to use the Four Energies, the Five Flavors, and the Four Movements to prescribe various herbal treatments, as well as acupuncture and other methods of pain relief.

His life and careers were so varied and successful that he remains, even today, the epitome of the self-made man. Born into a humble tradesman's family, this adaptable genius rose to become an architect of the world's first democracy, a leading light in Enlightenment science, and a major creator of what has come to be known as the American character. Journalist, musician, politician, scientist, humorist, inventor, civic leader, printer, writer, publisher, businessman, founding father, and philosopher, Franklin is a touchstone for America's egalitarianism.</p><p>The first volume traces young Franklin's life to his marriage in 1730. It traces the New England religious, political, and cultural contexts, exploring previously unknown influences on his philosophy and writing, and attributing new writings to him. After his move to Philadelphia, made famous in his <i>Autobiography</i>, Franklin became the Water American in London in 1725, where he was welcomed into that city's circle of freethinkers. Upon his return to the colonies, the sociable Franklin created a group of young friends, the Junto, devoted to self-improvement and philanthropy. He also started his own press and began to edit and publish the <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>, which became the most popular American paper of its day and the first to consistently feature American news.</p></p><p>J. A. Leo Lemay (1935-2006) was H. F. du Pont Winterthur Professor of English at the University of Delaware. He wrote extensively on early American literature and is the author of numerous books, including The American Dream of Captain John Smith.<p>Prologue: Quandary</p><p>In August 1723 seventeen-year-old Franklin found himself jobless and ostracized. He had been working for his older brother, James Franklin, who was now twenty-six. Six months before, when James was forbidden by the authorities to continue printing his newspaper unless it were first supervised by the secretary of Massachusetts, he brought out the newspaper under the name of Benjamin Franklin. Since Franklin was apprenticed to James, the latter returned him the cancelled indenture so that he could, if challenged, show it to the Massachusetts authorities. At the same time, Franklin and James signed another, secret indenture, whereby Franklin agreed to continue his apprenticeship with James. But the brothers often argued, and when they next quarreled, James beat his young brother, and Franklin quit. He could do so, for he knew that James could not produce the new indenture to the authorities and force Franklin to come back to work. Later, in the Autobiography, Franklin ruminated: "It was not fair in me to take this Advantage, and this I therefore reckon one of the first Errata of my Life: But the Unfairness of it weigh'd little with me, when under the Impressions of Resentment, for the Blows his Passion too often urg'd him to bestow upon me. Tho' He was otherwise not an ill-natur'd man. Perhaps I was too saucy and provoking" (20).</p><p>Franklin knew that he was as fast and efficient a printer as his brother or any Boston journeyman, and he assumed that he could find work at one of the several other Boston printers. He probably first went to Thomas Fleet, a young printer whom he knew well, but Fleet refused to hire him. Since Fleet's business was expanding and since good journeymen printers were rare in Boston, Franklin was puzzled. But when the printers John Allen and Samuel Kneeland also refused to hire him, he began to suspect the truth. Old Bartholomew Green, his father's friend and fellow member of the Old South Church, a person whom Franklin had known all his life, also turned him down. Franklin realized that his brother had told every local printer that Franklin was really still apprenticed to him. No Boston printer would hire him. What was he to do? There were no printers in the surrounding towns, and he could not sail from Boston, for his father and his brother could force him back if he tried to book passage. Besides, he had little money, not enough to pay for a voyage.</p><p>Worse, he had become notorious in Boston as an infidel. He enjoyed arguing and practiced a Socratic method of asking questions and having his opponents agree with statements that gradually led them to conclusions they had not foreseen. He confessed in the Autobiography that his "indiscrete Disputations about Religion began to make me pointed at with Horror by good People, as an Infidel or Atheist" (20). Moreover, he was infamous as a radical, whose newspaper writings insulted the best-known ministers of Boston, Cotton and Increase Mather, and who satirized the old, greatly respected chief justice, Samuel Sewall. The sensitive adolescent found that his writing and his private Socratic arguments had ostracized him from many good people in Boston. Some parents told their children to have nothing to do with him. How did he find himself in this predicament, and how did he make such a mess of his life by age seventeen? And what could he do?</p></p><h2>Off the Planet: Surviving Five Perilous Months Aboard the Space Station Mir</h2><p>&#x201c;An engrossing report.&#x201d;&#x2015;Booklist &#x201c;Vividly captures the challenges and privations [Dr. Linenger] endured both before and during his flight.&#x201d;&#x2015;Library Journal Nothing on earth compares to Off the Planet&#x2015;Dr. Jerry Linenger&#x2019;s dramatic account of space exploration turned survival mission during his 132 days aboard the decaying and unstable Russian space station Mir. Not since Apollo 13 has an American astronaut faced so many catastrophic malfunctions and life-threatening emergencies in one mission. In his remarkable narrative, Linenger chronicles power outages that left the crew in complete darkness, tumbling out of control; chemical leaks and near collisions that threatened to rupture Mir&#x2019;s hull; and most terrifying of all&#x2015;a raging fire that almost destroyed the space station and the lives of its entire crew.</p><p>Imagine yourself in a decaying space station far away from the atmosphere you never realized you needed so badly, not knowing if the next malfunction would kill you or merely keep you busy. Dr. Jerry M. Linenger experienced just this and describes his harrowing but ennobling five months aboard <i>Mir</i> in <i>Off the Planet</i>, a memoir that evokes the excitement of living every day as a life-threatening adventure. Linenger's very personal writing style draws the reader into the story quickly, breezing through his childhood, Annapolis training, medical school, and selection as an astronaut, then moving quickly to the <i>Mir</i> assignment and its aftermath.<p> Linenger isn't shy about sharing his opinions. Chapter titles like "Broken Trust" and "An Attempted Coverup" show his feelings about the bizarre relationship between the crew and mission control that may have kept him and his Russian comrades in constant danger. He also heaps praise on his fellow crew members and family for their strength and perseverance throughout the mission--between communication difficulties, the cloud of doubt surrounding the station's systems, and problems like fires and toxic fumes, it's a wonder anyone survived with their sanity intact. The full-color pictures accompanying the text add further insight into life aboard <i>Mir</i>. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>It was like nothing on Earth. &#34;An unvarnished account of his near-disastrous stay, in 1997, on Russia&#39;s creaky space station...an engrossing report that NASA&#39;s publicity machine will bemoan.&#34;--Booklist. &#34;[Linenger&#39;s] frank, personable prose shows readers what it&#39;s like to be an astronaut--or at least to be this particular astronaut, trying, along with his Russian companions, to live and work with good humor on an 11-year-old, half-broken, famously flammable space station as its air fills with antifreeze that is leaking out of shoddy cooling lines.&#34;--Publishers Weekly. &#34;NASA astronaut Linenger spent five months aboard the Russian space station Mir, a spacecraft operating far beyond its design life.

But now Hallie is abroad and Codi, troubled and lost, is returning after a fifteen-year absence to confront her past and face her ailing father. What Codi finds is a town threatened by a silent catastrophe, some startling clues to her own identity, and a man whose view of the world could change the course of her life. And what she learns about herself though experiences, dreams and conversations becomes an invaluable tool to unravelling the discontent - and the &#39;something&#39; that has haunted her since childhood.</p><p><p>"Animals dream about the things they do in the daytime just like people do. If you want sweet dreams, you've got to live a sweet life." So says Loyd Peregrina, a handsome Apache trainman and latter-day philosopher.

His dark and unsettling short stories and novels were shaped in large part by personal experience (a professional merchant mariner for much of his life, many of Hodgson&#x2019;s tales are set at sea), and his work evokes a disturbing sense of the amorphous and horrific unknown.<br> While his nautical adventure fiction was very popular during his lifetime, the supernatural and cosmic horror he is most remembered for only became well known after his death, mainly due to the efforts of writers like H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith, who often praised his work and cited it as an influence on their own. By the latter half of the twentieth century, it was only his weird fiction that remained in print, and his vast catalog of non-supernatural stories was extremely hard to find.<br> Night Shade Books&#x2019;s five-volume series presents all of Hodgson&#x2019;s unique and timeless fiction. Each volume contains one of Hodgson's novels, along with a selection of thematically-linked short fiction, including a number of works reprinted for the first time since their original publication. The final book of the five-volume set, <i>The Dream of X and Other Fantastic Visions</i>, collects all of Hodgson&#x2019;s miscellaneous writings, "revisions&#x201d;, and altered works for US publication, including <i>The Dream of X</i>, a condensed, Hodgson-edited version of <i>The Night Land</i>. <br><br><b>The Complete Fiction of William Hope Hodgson is published by Night Shade Books in the following volumes:</b><br><i>The Boats of the &#x201c;Glen Carrig&#x201d; and Other Nautical Adventures</i><br><i>The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places</i><br><i>The Ghost Pirates and Other Revenants of the Sea</i><br><i>The Night Land and Other Romances</i><br><i>The Dream of X and Other Fantastic Visions</i></p><p><p><strong>William Hope Hodsgon</strong>&nbsp;(November 15, 1877 &#x2013; April 1918) was an English author. He produced a large body of work, consisting of essays, short fiction, and novels, spanning several overlapping genresincluding horror, fantastic fiction and science fiction.</p>This final volume of works by English author, disillusioned sailor and bodybuilder Hodgson (1877&#x2013;1918) presents 31 strange and unsettling visions of fantasy, horror and future worlds both terrifyingly close to and infinitely removed from our own, including several condensations and alternate versions of Hodgson's best known works. Despite some labored archaisms and obtrusive dialects, the emotional depth of the poignant Valley of Lost Children and the searing Judge Barclay's Wife exemplifies Hodgson's penetrating insight into the abuses society masks beneath its supposed values and ideals, while the eerily Swiftian Date 1965: Modern Warfare, written in 1908, foresees the horrors of the trenches. Today's readers will find it a struggle, but one worth undertaking. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Historical debate about the origin of racial slavery has focused on the status of the Negro in seventeenth-century Virginia and Maryland. However, as Theodore W. Allen argues in this magisterial work, what needs to be studied is the transformation of English, Scottish, Irish and other European colonists from their various statuses as servants, tenants, planters or merchants into a single new all-inclusive status: that of whites. This is the key to the paradox of American history, of a democracy resting on race assumptions.<br><br>Volume One of this two-volume work attempts to escape the &#x201c;white blind spot&#x201d; which has distorted consecutive studies of the issue. It does so by looking in the mirror of Irish history for a definition of racial oppression and for an explanation of that phenomenon in terms of social control, free from the absurdities of classification by skin color. Compelling analogies are presented between the history of Anglo-Irish and British rule in Ireland and American White Supremacist oppression of Indians and African-Americans. But the relativity of race is shown in the sea change it entailed, whereby emigrating Irish haters of racial oppression were transformed into White Americans who defended it. The reasons for the differing outcomes of Catholic Emancipation and Negro Emancipation are considered and occasion is made to demonstrate Allen&#x2019;s distinction between racial and national oppression.</p><p><b>Theodore W. Allen</b> (1919&#x2013;2005) was an anti&#x2013;white supremacist, working-class intellectual and activist who began his pioneering work on &#x201c;white skin privilege&#x201d; and &#x201c;white race&#x201d; privilege in 1965. He co-authored the influential <i>White Blindspot</i> (1967), authored &#x201c;Can White Workers Radicals Be Radicalized?&#x201d; (1969), and wrote the ground-breaking<i> Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race</i> (1975) before publication of his seminal two-volume classic <i>The Invention of the White Race</i> (1994, 1997).&#x201c;A monumental study of the birth of racism in the American South which makes truly new and convincing points about one of the most critical problems in US history a highly original and seminal work.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Roediger, University of Missouri</p><h2>1066: The Hidden History in the Bayeux Tapestry</h2><p><p>For more than 900 years the Bayeux Tapestry has preserved one of history's greatest dramas: the Norman Conquest of England, culminating in the death of King Harold at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Historians have held for centuries that the majestic tapestry trumpets the glory of William the Conqueror and the victorious Normans. But is this true? In 1066, a brilliant piece of historical detective work, Andrew Bridgeford reveals a very different story that reinterprets and recasts the most decisive year in English history.</p><p>Reading the tapestry as if it were a written text, Bridgeford discovers a wealth of new information subversively and ingeniously encoded in the threads, which appears to undermine the Norman point of view while presenting a secret tale undetected for centuries-an account of the final years of Anglo-Saxon England quite different from the Norman version.</p><p>Bridgeford brings alive the turbulent 11th century in western Europe, a world of ambitious warrior bishops, court dwarfs, ruthless knights, and powerful women. 1066 offers readers a rare surprise-a book that reconsiders a long-accepted masterpiece, and sheds new light on a pivotal chapter of English history.</p></p><p><p><b>Andrew Bridgeford</b> is a lawyer and a historian. He lives on the Isle of Jersey in the United Kingdom.</p>The simple linen background and bright woolen colors of the Bayeux Tapestry have always been interpreted as a French tribute to William the Conqueror, celebrating his victory over England in 1066 with its depiction of soldiers, archers, ships and battles. In an often riveting but ultimately unconvincing revisionist account drawing on the work of other scholars as well as on contemporary accounts of events, Bridgeford, a British lawyer, argues that the tapestry was more likely designed by English monks at St. Augustine's abbey in Canterbury under the direction of Count Eustace of Boulogne. English women, more famous for their embroidery skills than the French, stitched a tapestry containing a covert anti-Norman message. Bridgeford also provides details on minor characters in the tapestry, such as the dwarf Turold&#x2014;who Bridgeford thinks might have written the medieval French epic poem <i>Chanson de Roland</i> and been the tapestry's patron&#x2014;and Aelfgyva, the only woman named on the tapestry. While Bridgeford offers a fascinating look into the tapestry and the events it depicts, his language and method are so tentative ("Could it be that...?") that one is left doubting his interpretation. 16 pages of color illus., one map. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With the stroke of a pen the Jesuit fathers banned the doctrine of infinitesimals, announcing that it could never be taught or even mentioned. The concept was deemed dangerous and subversive, a threat to the belief that the world was an orderly place, governed by a strict and unchanging set of rules. If infinitesimals were ever accepted, the Jesuits feared, the entire world would be plunged into chaos.</p><p>In <i>Infinitesimal</i>, the award-winning historian Amir Alexander exposes the deep-seated reasons behind the rulings of the Jesuits and shows how the doctrine persisted, becoming the foundation of calculus and much of modern mathematics and technology. Indeed, not everyone agreed with the Jesuits. Philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians across Europe embraced infinitesimals as the key to scientific progress, freedom of thought, and a more tolerant society. As Alexander reveals, it wasn't long before the two camps set off on a war that pitted Europe's forces of hierarchy and order against those of pluralism and change.</p><p>The story takes us from the bloody battlefields of Europe's religious wars and the English Civil War and into the lives of the greatest mathematicians and philosophers of the day, including Galileo and Isaac Newton, Cardinal Bellarmine and Thomas Hobbes, and Christopher Clavius and John Wallis. In Italy, the defeat of the infinitely small signaled an end to that land's reign as the cultural heart of Europe, and in England, the triumph of infinitesimals helped launch the island nation on a course that would make it the world's first modern state.</p><p> From the imperial cities of Germany to the green hills of Surrey, from the papal palace in Rome to the halls of the Royal Society of London, Alexander demonstrates how a disagreement over a mathematical concept became a contest over the heavens and the earth. The legitimacy of popes and kings, as well as our beliefs in human liberty and progressive science, were at stake-the soul of the modern world hinged on the infinitesimal.</p></p><p><b>Amir Alexander</b> teaches history at UCLA.

Shriver tells the story of Kate, who finds that making friends with a mentally retarded boy helps her learn that the two of them have a lot in common.</p><p>When 8-year-old Kate meets a boy who seems somehow different, she feels funny inside. After talking with her mom, though, Kate begins to understand that Timmy is just like her in many ways. Timmy has special needs; he takes longer to learn than Kate, and can't walk or run as well. But he also "loves his family, he wants friends, he goes to school, and he dreams about what he wants to be when he grows up." Kate and Timmy meet, and the seeds of a friendship are planted. <p> For all those children who ask their parents why someone looks or acts "different," author and journalist Maria Shriver's <i>What's Wrong with Timmy?</i> provides a base for discussion. Kate's mother models appropriate behavior, speaking to her daughter calmly and directly, and providing examples from her own life to help Kate understand about Timmy. Illustrator Sandra Speidel's soft, intentionally hazy pastels are lovely; bold, enlarged phrases on the opposite pages of text act as captions.

Yet when his estranged grandfather dies, leaving him everything, he'll travel to Valley Falls, New York&#x2014;but only to collect his sister and his inheritance. He won't be roped into saving a floundering girls' school, no matter what mathematics teacher Elizabeth Wells says.&nbsp;<br><br>Elizabeth has defied social convention and her own family for the sake of her beloved Hayes Academy. Luke is pure rancher, from the tip of his Stetson to the scuff on his boots, yet he's also becoming her unlikely ally. Only he can help save her job and school...but how much will she lose when the time comes for him to leave?</p><p>A mother of two young boys, Naomi Rawlings spends her days picking up, cleaning, playing, and writing historical novels that matter for today. Her husband pastors a small church in Michigan&#39;s rugged Upper Peninsula, where her family shares its ten wooded acres with black bears, wolves, coyotes, deer and bald eagles. Naomi and her family live only three miles from Lake Superior, where the scenery is beautiful and they average 200 inches of snow per winter.<i>Valley Falls, New York</i><br><br>The simple cotton curtains on the classroom window fluttered with a whispered breeze, while autumn sunlight flooded through the opening in the thin fabric and bathed her in a burst of gaiety. But the warm rays upon Elizabeth Wells's skin didn't penetrate the coldness that stole up her spine, numbing her lungs and turning her fingers to ice.<br><br>Elizabeth tightened her grip around the envelope in her hand. She could open it. It wasn't such a hard thing, really, to slip the letter opener inside and slit the top. She just needed a moment to brace herself.<br><br>The envelope weighed heavy against her skin, as though it were made of lead rather than paper. She ran her fingers instinctively along the smooth, precise edges. A quadrilateral with two pairs of congruent sides joined by four right angles. The mathematical side of her brain recognized the shape as a perfect rectangle. But the contour of the paper didn't matter nearly so much as what was written inside.<br><br>She sighed and glanced down, her gaze resting on the name printed boldly across the envelope.<br><br><i>Miss Elizabeth Wells Instructor of Mathematics Hayes Academy for Girls</i><br><br>Forcing the air out of her lungs, she slit the envelope from the Albany Ladies' Society and slipped out the paper.<br><br><i>Dear Miss Wells...</i><br><br>The jumble of words and phrases from the letter seared her mind. <i>Regret to inform you...revoking our funding from your school...donate money to an institution that appreciates women maintaining their proper sphere in society.</i> And then the clincher. The Albany Ladies' Society not only wanted to stop any future funding but also requested the return of the money they had already donated for the school year.<br><br>And they called themselves ladies. Elizabeth slammed the letter onto her desk. Two other organizations had also asked that money previously donated&#x2014;and spent&#x2014;be returned. Then there were the six other letters explaining why future funding would cease but not asking for a return of monies.<br><br>This request galled more than most. If even women cared nothing about educating the younger generation of ladies, then who would? She'd spoken personally to the Albany Ladies' Society three times. Her mother was a member, and still, at the slightest bit of public opposition to the school, the society had pulled their funding.<br><br>She stuffed the letter back into the envelope, yanked out her bottom desk drawer, and tossed it inside with the other letters&#x2014;and the articles that had started the firestorm.<br><br>She shouldn't even be receiving letters from donors and disgruntled citizens. Her brother, Jackson, was the head accountant for Hayes Academy for Girls, not her.<br><br>But then Jackson wasn't responsible for the mess the academy was in.<br><br>She was.<br><br>She'd only been trying to help. With the recession that had hit the area following the economic panic in March, the school had lost students. A lot of students. Many parents couldn't afford to send their daughters to an institution such as Hayes any longer. And without those tuition dollars, the school risked being seriously underfunded. So she'd written an editorial delineating the advantages of female education and girls' academies and had sent it to the paper.<br><br>She'd hoped to convince a couple families to enroll their daughters or perhaps encourage donations to the school. Instead, she'd convinced Mr. Reginald Higsley, one of the reporters at the Albany <i>Morning Times,</i> to answer her.<br><br>On the front page.<br><br>She pulled out the newspaper, the headline staring back at her with thick, black letters.<br><br><b>Excessive Amount of Charity Money Wasted on Hayes Academy for Girls</b><br><br>Since the economic panic in March and the ensuing depression, countless workers remain unemployed, food lines span city blocks, four railroad companies have declared bankruptcy, three Albany banks have failed and myriad farmers have been forced to let their mortgaged lands revert back to lending institutions. But not six miles away, in the neighboring town of Valley Falls, community and charity money is being wasted on keeping open an unneeded school, Hayes Academy for Girls.<br><br>It has long been recognized that the overedu-cating of females creates a breed of women quick to throw off their societal obligations to marry and raise children. It is also well-known that educated women are more concerned with employment opportunities and their own selfish wishes rather than fulfilling their roles as women....<br><br>Elizabeth's stomach twisted. No matter how many times her eyes darted over the words, the opening made her nearly retch. The article went on to compare the lower marriage rate of women with college educations to those with only grammar schooling. It examined the divorce rate, also higher among women with college educations. And then the reporter turned back to the topic of Hayes Academy's funding, questioning why anyone would waste money teaching women to throw off their societal responsibilities while the poor of Albany were starving.<br><br>Elizabeth shoved back from her desk and stood. Charity money "wasted" on keeping an "unneeded" institution open? How could the reporter say such a thing, when the academy prepared young women to attend college and qualify for jobs that enabled them to support both themselves and their families? An educated woman could certainly make a fuller contribution to society than an uneducated one.<br><br>Yet since the article had appeared, the academy had lost half of its financial backers.<br><br>A burst of giggles wafted from outside, and Elizabeth rose and headed to the window. In the yard, groups of girls clustered about the pristine lawn and giant maple trees with their reddening leaves. They laughed and smiled and talked, flitting over the grass alone or in packs, their eyes bright, their spirits free, their futures optimistic.<br><br>She sank her head against the dark trim surrounding the window. "Jonah, why did you go and die on me?"<br><br>The words swirled and dissipated in the empty room. As though she'd never spoken them. As though no one heard or cared what a mess Hayes Academy had become when its founder unexpectedly died three months earlier.<br><br>If Jonah Hayes were still alive, he would know how to get more donors. He would write an editorial on women's education, and people would listen, enrolling their daughters at the academy. And in the interim, while the school struggled through the recession, he would likely donate the money Hayes Academy needed to continue operating.<br><br>But Jonah Hayes was gone, and his estate had been tied up for three months, waiting for the arrival of his grandson heir from out West. In her dreams, the grandson came to Valley Falls, filled Jonah's position on the school board, convinced the other board members to keep Hayes Academy open, obliterated all opposition to the academy.<br><br>Of course, the heir had to arrive first.<br><br>And at this rate, the academy would be closed and the building sold before the man got here.<br><br>The students returned from lunch, a cascade of laughter and conversations fluttering in their wake. Elizabeth tried to smile, tried to straighten her shoulders and stand erect, tried to be grateful for the chance to teach her students&#x2014;an opportunity that she might not have in another month.<br><br>Tried, but failed.<br><br>"Miss Wells?" The shining blue eyes of Samantha Hayes, Jonah's granddaughter and one of the academy's most intelligent pupils, met hers. "Meredith, MaryAnne and I are going to have a picnic along the stream that runs through Grandfather's estate tonight. Do you want to join us?"<br><br>Elizabeth did smile then, though it doubtless looked small and halfhearted. How enjoyable to spend the evening chatting with the girls beside the clear stream, watching autumn swirl. If only she didn't have to find a way out of the financial mess she'd created for Hayes Academy, which meant she had an appointment for tonight with the extra set of ledgers she kept for the school. "I'd best not. Thank you for asking."<br><br>"Are you feeling all right?" Concern flitted across the young lady's face. "You look pale."<br><br>"I'm fine, but. .well, now that I think of it, I could use your help on a certain project tomorrow."<br><br>Samantha's eyes danced, light from the window streaming in to bounce off her golden tresses. The girl was breathtaking. More than breathtaking, really. Elizabeth smiled. Little surprise her brother, Jackson, had started courting Samantha Hayes last spring. Half the men of Albany would be courting her if they had any sense about them.<br><br>"Is it more calculus?"<br><br>She did smile then, full and genuine. If only all her students were as exuberant over calculus as Samantha Hayes. "I'm afraid not. I've some ciphering to do tonight, and I'd like for you to check my sums."<br><br>Samantha excelled at finding discrepancies in account books, whether they be the school's or Jonah Hayes's or Elizabeth's personal ledgers. "Sounds fun. Should we meet at the picnic spot around lunchtime tomorrow, then?"<br><br>If Samantha knew the state of Hayes Academy's accounts, she wouldn't be nearly so happy. Oh, well, the younger girl would find out tomorrow.<br><br>"Yes, that will be fine, but you'd best take your seat now." Elizabeth moved to the chalkboard and turned toward her students. Thirteen expectant faces stared back at her. Last year, she'd had twenty-three in her advanced algebra class.<br><br>"Today we're going to learn about.."<br><br>But she couldn't finish. How could she, with the school struggling to pay its bills and teachers' salaries? Did the girls understand how much funding had been pulled from the academy within the past five days? That they might not be able to finish their final year of high school if more students didn't enroll or if new funds couldn't be raised?<br><br>And part of it was her fault. Oh, what had ever possessed her to write that editorial?<br><br>"Miss Wells, are you feeling okay?"<br><br>"Can we do something for you?"<br><br>"Did you forget what you were saying?"<br><br>The voices floated from different corners of the room. Elizabeth plastered a smile on her face. "Forgive me, class, but I've decided to change the lesson. We'll review today."<br><br>Her hand flew across the chalkboard as her mind formed the numbers, letters and symbols without needing to consult a textbook for sample equations. "I'm giving you a surprise quiz. Take the next half hour to finish these quadratic equations, and we'll check them at the end of class." She wiped her chalk-covered hands on a rag and turned.<br><br>A shadow moved near the open classroom door, and the darkened frame of a man filled the doorway.<br><br>A man. At Hayes Academy for <i>Girls.</i> What was he doing here?<br><br>"Can I help you?"<br><br>He entered and dipped his head. "Excuse me, ma'am." A Western drawl lingered on the rusted voice.<br><br>"You're here!" Samantha screeched.<br><br>Elizabeth nearly cringed at the unladylike sound, but Samantha took no notice as she sprang from her desk and rushed toward the gentleman. "I can't believe you finally came. I missed you so much!" Samantha threw her arms around him for all the world to see.<br><br>Most unladylike, indeed. Did Jackson know about this other man? These were hardly fit actions for a girl who'd had an understanding with another man since last spring.<br><br>"Samantha..." Elizabeth drew up her shoulders and stepped closer. Their quiz forgotten, the other students watched the spectacle. "Sir, if the two of you would accompany me into the hallway. Students, please continue working."<br><br>The girls returned to their work&#x2014;or attempted to. Half still peeked up despite their bent heads.<br><br>Elizabeth moved to the door and held it for Samantha and the stranger. Neither moved. She anchored her hands to her hips and ground her teeth together. Of all the days. Didn't the Good Lord know she hadn't the patience for such an interruption this afternoon?<br><br>The man hugged Samantha, bracing her shoulders with a hand that held... <i>a cowboy hat?</i> Elizabeth blinked. Surely she didn't have a cowboy in her classroom. Her eyes drifted down his long, lanky form. He wore a blue striped shirt, some type of leather vest, a brown belt and tan trousers complemented by a pair of what could only be called cowboy boots. And was that a red kerchief around his neck?<br><br>Plus he was covered in dust&#x2014;whether from traveling or working with cows, she didn't know&#x2014;but she could well imagine the dust embedding itself on the front of Samantha's&#x2014;<br><br>A cowboy. From out West.<br><br>No. It couldn't be.<br><br>But it was. She knew it then, as surely as she knew how to solve the quadratic equations on the board. Samantha clung to her brother.<br><br>The Hayes heir.<br><br>The man who held the power to either continue Hayes Academy or close the school for good.<br><br>"Samantha?" Elizabeth's vocal cords grated against each other as she spoke, but she had to get her student and Mr. Hayes out of the classroom.<br><br>Finally, the girl pulled back from her brother and looked around the roomful of staring students. She flushed and moved into the hall, the dark skirt of her school uniform swishing about her ankles. The cowboy followed but only to crush his sister against him in another embrace.<br><br>Elizabeth wasn't sure whether to roll her eyes or scream.<br><br>Luke Hayes hadn't hugged his sister in three years, two months and thirteen days&#x2014;not that he'd been counting&#x2014;and he didn't plan to stop hugging her because some fancy teacher squawked at him like a broody hen dead set on guarding her eggs.<br><br>"I'm sorry, Sam. I didn't mean to get you in trouble," he spoke against her head, still unable to unwind his arms from her.<br><br>"It's all right," came her muffled reply.<br><br>She'd grown taller and curvier since he'd seen her last. Looked grown-up, too. Her hair was done up in a puffy bun, not long and free as it had been in the Teton Valley. And she smelled different, no longer of sunshine and wildflowers but like fancy perfume. He tightened his hold. He should have come and yanked her out of this school sooner, regardless of what Pa had to say about it. "I missed you. Can't rightly say how much."<br><br>Inside the classroom, the teacher said something in that stern voice of hers. Then the distinctive clip of a lady's boots on wood flooring grew louder, and the door closed with a <i>thunk.</i> "Samantha Hayes, what is the meaning of this?"<br><br>Sam pulled away from him, her eyes finding the floor. "I'm sorry, Miss Wells. I didn't mean to make a scene. This is my brother, Luke, from Wyoming."<br><br>The hair on the back of his neck prickled. Sam didn't need to cower like a whipped dog because she had hugged him. He crossed his arms and met the teacher's stare.<br><br>Hang it all, but she was a beautiful little thing, with deep hazel eyes and a wag of reddish-brown hair piled atop her head.<br><br>Her name should be Eve, for if ever God had created a perfect woman, she was it. Adam would have taken one look at that long, smooth face, milky skin and sparkling hazel eyes and been lost.<br><br>Good thing he wasn't Adam.<br><br>"Sir?"</p><h2>The Ballad of Gussie &amp; Clyde: A True Story of True Love</h2><p>As romantic as The Bridges of Madison County, this moving, revealing, true story recounts the tale of an elderly couple, Clyde Latham and Gussie Lancaster, who find love in their eighties.</p><p>as The Bridges of Madison County, this moving, revealing, true story recounts the tale of an elderly couple, Clyde Latham and Gussie Lancaster, who find love in their eighties.A son's affectionate but sketchy little memoir of the bittersweet romance between his octogenarian father, Clyde, and Gussie, a widow of similar years. Latham, a New York journalist (Rolling Stone, Esquire) and screenwriter (Urban Cowboy, etc.) became concerned when his newly widowed father back in the tiny west Texas town of Spur began to develop a long-distance telephone relationship with a former childhood friend living in California. After numerous broken promises to come back to Spur for a brief visit, Gussie eventually made the trip, and the telephone romance quickly flowered into an engagement. Latham, in plain, rather flat prose, shows the old couple revisting childhood scenes, getting reacquainted, and even necking in a parked car like a couple of teenagers. When Gussie returned to California, Clyde followed her the next day, and a week later the impetuous couple was married. Harboring major reservations about his father's whirlwind romance, Latham, accompanied by his wife, 60 Minutes reporter Lesley Stahl, flew out to meet his new stepmother and discovered that Gussie's family tree was entwined with his father's in a surprising way. A few months later, Clyde became dangerously ill, had one leg amputated, and underwent abdominal surgery. In the book's final chapter, the honeymoon may be over, but love persists. The last image Latham gives us is a tender one: the two old newlyweds ``sitting side by side in their recliners, fast asleep, smiling, holding hands.'' Of such images are television movies-of-the-week made. The message that love knows no age barriers would be perfect around Valentine's Day, and actors might bring some life to Latham's two-dimensional characters. Wait for the screen version.

So began the classic 1968 film Yellow Submarine, inspired by a song and hailed as an avant-garde amalgam of pop art, Beatles music, and highly innovative animation. Now that film's dazzling images &#x2014; and its lighthearted, witty tale &#x2014; is showcased in a glorious picture book sure to be savored by fans and readers of all ages.</p><p>Inspired by the song "Yellow Submarine" from the Beatles' Revolver album, the film YELLOW SUBMARINE was released in 1968 and was quickly hailed as a visionary masterpiece. This extraordinary collaboration of talent &#x2014; Heinz Edelmann's art wedded with Beatles music &#x2014; was brought to life in celluloid with groundbreaking animation techniques. More than thirty-five years later, the film continues to beguile adults and children alike.Grade 1-5&#x2013;In 1968, the movie <i>Yellow Submarine</i> broke new ground by combining popular songs with clever animation to tell a surrealistic story. This book combines an adaptation of the screenplay with artwork from the film. When Pepperland is threatened by the Blue Meanies and its inhabitants are turned into colorless statues, Captain Fred climbs into a yellow submarine and sets off to get help. After landing in Liverpool, he returns with the Beatles and together they journey underwater through the Sea of Monsters, are sucked into an inside-outside world, and survive the Sea of Holes. Eventually, they return to Pepperland to discover that the Fab Four fit into the uniforms of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. When they begin to sing, everything returns to normal and even the Blue Meanies are transformed into kinder, gentler beings. Trying to translate the ebullience of the movie into a book is a daunting challenge, one that doesn't quite succeed. The text has some of the wonderful puns from the movie, but somehow they fall flat here. Some references might be over the heads of many youngsters. The illustrations combine slightly blurry film cels with pop-art cartoons of the main characters. The color palette is off with some of the yellows turned greenish. Neither the words nor the music of the title song are included. Still, for children who are interested in animation and movies, this book does have a place.<i>&#x2013;Bina Williams, Bridgeport Public Library, CT</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There, among an assortment of literary rarities, he discovers a manuscript in verse, an Ace Double Novel, and a scattering of very old cigarette butts. These commonplace objects serve as catalysts for an extraordinary--and unpredictable--adventure.<br><br>Without warning, Blanzac finds himself traversing a 'circle of discontinuity' that leads from the present day to the San Francisco of 1957. Caught up in that circle are an ancient Sumerian deity, a forgotten Beat-era poet named Sophie Greenwald, and an apocalyptic cult in search of the key to absolute non-existence. With unobtrusive artistry, Powers weaves these elements into something strange and utterly compelling. The resulting story is at once a romance, a thriller, and the kind of intricately constructed time travel story that only the author of The Anubis Gates--that quintessential time travel classic--could have written. Ingenious, affecting, and endlessly inventive, Salvage and Demoliton is a compact gem from the pen of a modern master, a man whose singular creations never fail to dazzle and delight.</p><p>*Starred Review* It might be small, but Powers&#x2019; novella packs a wallop. Rare-book dealer Richard Blanzac receives a box of items on consignment, among which is a verse manuscript written, apparently, by one Sophie Greenwald. Before he&#x2019;s quite figured out what the manuscript is, he gets a call from a stranger, an elderly woman, who begs him to destroy it. And, soon after that, he encounters a man claiming to be a scholar who seems quite intent on getting his hands on the manuscript. Baffling as those two incidents are, they pale by comparison to the next thing that happens: Blanzac is transported 55 years back in time, where he meets the author of the manuscript, who tells him that she has already encountered him earlier that same day (although that meeting lies, apparently, in Richard&#x2019;s own future) and that the manuscript, if it lands in the wrong hands, could have terrible, world-altering consequences. Evoking such genre notables as Richard Matheson&#x2019;s Bid Time Return, Jack Finney&#x2019;s Time and Again, and Audrey Niffenegger&#x2019;s The Time Traveler&#x2019;s Wife (along with such films as Source Code and The Terminator), the book is a sort of literary M�bius strip, looping around on itself, finding its ending in its beginning. Powers is an acclaimed SF and fantasy author&#x2014;The Anubis Gates (1983) is considered a time-travel classic&#x2014;and this new title has the feel of a cult favorite, the kind of small-press jewel that will develop a devoted following. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Old Gods Waken</h2><p>This book is used, but in good condition.

This biography provides a complete look at this iconoclastic figure. 24 photos.</p><p>Folkways Records founder Moe Asch's significance as a curator of America's folk music can hardly be overstated. As this thoroughly researched biography reveals, Asch initially saw himself as a businessman, not a folklorist. It just so happened his success as the latter is what made him a name long before he saw any real reward for his efforts. That Asch, a would-be inventor, ranks among archivists Sam Charters (who initially worked for Asch) and John and Alan Lomax in importance is a consequence of two folk giants who recorded for his Folkways label early on; the volumes of Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly recordings preserved by Folkways remains Asch's legacy. If Guthrie and Asch were to wrangle on occasion, Goldsmith points out, their mutual respect was as foreign to the music business of that period as it would be today. The same can be said of the relationship between the loud Asch and the quiet eccentric Harry Smith, compiler of the labels' six-volume Anthology of American Folk Music, recently reissued to much ado. Music fans in search of the next big thing will have little use for Asch. But folkies, young and old alike, who waited for Smith's set on CD, or were thankful for a reissue of Bahamian guitarist Joseph Spence or Southern Child ballads, owe much to the Yiddish writer Sholem Asch's son. His legacy may often have been born of another's art, but it was no less a piece with his own aesthetic vision. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.One of the most important figures in American folk music probably never picked up a guitar. Yet Moe Asch (1905^-86), founder of Folkways Records, was instrumental in popularizing and preserving America's musical traditions. During its 40-year history, Folkways released nearly 2,200 recordings by a roster of artists that constitutes a folk music who's who, starting with Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, and Pete Seeger. Reflecting Asch's socialist convictions and idealism, Folkways disdained commercial considerations. Reflecting his eclectic tastes, Folkways also recorded jazz musicians Art Tatum and Coleman Hawkins, poet Langston Hughes, and avant-gardist John Cage. As son of the noted Jewish novelist Sholem Asch, Asch had an interesting background, and he was always eccentric (cantankerous, emotionally stunted, socially inept). Still, Goldsmith has a hard time making the early part of this biography come alive, perhaps because it wasn't until Asch was 34 that his work in radio electronics led him to start recording. Goldsmith's thorough, sometimes ponderous book reveals the vision that underlies Asch's monumental legacy of recordings. <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>Astrology for Lovers</h2><p>Looks at the characteristics, mythology and sensuality of each sign of the zodiac and offers advice on finding one&#39;s true love.

I did both with the owner of a Ford Festiva. If you're unfamiliar with the model, it's a cartoonishly small car. Imagine a large black man, dreadlocks tied in a blue bandanna, and a ponytailed brunette beside him; add cup holders and a stick shift, then laminate those people. That's a Festiva. And that was us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was a chain-smoker, former drummer in a hardcore punk band. I was a chain-smoker, former valedictorian. He rapped with a group of guys who called themselves Doomtree; their CD featured a line drawing of a dead bird with Xs for eyes. I'd just started making music and I thought the stuff he produced was strange and incredible; he recorded performances that I would have scrapped out of hand as imperfect-vocal takes where he forgot a line and giggled, where his voice broke, where he was nearly out of breath. His songs didn't sound like the product of an artist in a big studio; they sounded like the proof of a person in a big feeling. He conducted even little, daily tasks in ways that would have never occurred to me. When I saw that he'd entered my number into his phone under eff oh echs, I asked, "What does that mean?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You'll get it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I thought for a moment. "I don't."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He laughed. "You're a fox."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At twenty-two, being loved by him was one of the best feelings I'd ever had. Now, single at thirty-six, and having traveled the world many times over, not too many feelings have compared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I�d grown up in South Minneapolis as a brainy middle-class kid. As a girl, my parents called me Chatty Cathy-a nickname derived from a doll popular during the sixties with a pull string on her back, who emitted a constant stream of chatter until the spring rewound. My mom says I announced my first real life goal from the throne of her office chair: �I want to have a conversation-you know, where I talk, then you talk, then I talk-but all about the same thing.� In grade school I was skinny, headstrong, but still eager to please. When I hit fourteen, dark moods started to cycle through. I cut off my long hair and walked down to the riverbank to dye it pink in the Mississippi. I started drinking and dressing as a boy; I ran away from home and slept outside for a few days, woke up fully clothed under a hedge to discover I�d started my period. Wearing a Lakers cap pulled low, gas station clerks called me sir when I paid for the candy on the counter. I nursed coffees at the Hard Times Cafe, a sanctuary then for happy anarchists, busted-ups, and punks. �Just so you know,� the barista said, then reached beneath the counter to lift up a stack of posters with my face on them. My mom had papered the city, but the barista assured me Hard Times wouldn�t hang them; I was safe there. It�d be a decade later, in a Saint Paul psych ward, that I�d learn there was a word for those moods, and that they often linked to menstrual cycles. But they were intermittent through my teens and I kept my grades up, managed to stay clear of any real trouble. By the time I went to college, I was brunette again. I studied philosophy, attracted by the imaginative depressives who spent their workdays debating the design of the world. I finished my coursework in three years with honors, leaving with a degree, a functional angst, and a burning ambition that wasn�t affixed to a particular objective. I knew I wanted to devote myself completely to something-I wanted to be like the stressed-out lawyers on TV dramas who paced through the night with loosened ties and take-out boxes. I wanted to be considered a success and I wanted to be on the right side of a hard fight. But I wasn�t sure what job or even what field to pursue. I was carrying a jet engine under my arm, looking for a plane.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the boy who'd eventually drive the Festiva did his growing up in an apartment unit, with a devoted single mom. He was a smiley, round-faced kid, with catlike, almost-black eyes. His dad split when he was six. He loved his mother effortlessly and absolutely, but had an irrepressible independent streak even when he was very small. Once, locked in the closet by a cousin, he managed to attract an adult rescue by banging against the door, his little muffled voice shouting in the dark, "You can't keep a black man down!" At fourteen, he got his first tattoo-leopard print on his left shoulder. He spent his teenage years skateboarding, learning to play bass, then drums. He recorded his bands onto cassettes, carried a rat in his pocket, did enough drugs to swear off them for a while, and eventually got expelled from high school for distributing anti-prom propaganda.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We spoke for the first time on the steps of The Playhouse, an arts compound in Uptown, Minneapolis. I was there visiting a friend, Yoni, who lived in the building. Although it's since burned down, The Playhouse had twelve bedrooms, a recording studio in the attic, a slide that went from the second floor to the basement, and an iguana that I remember as the sole occupant of one of the third-floor units. Yoni had recently invited me to join his band, a hip-hop outfit where I'd be one of three rappers. Initially, I'd been hesitant to accept. I knew how to write essays-I'd taken writing classes in college-and I had a good singing voice-I slayed Sheryl Crow and Fiona Apple at karaoke-but I'd never rapped before. Yoni had extended the offer based on the strength of a few pieces he'd seen me perform at a poetry slam. Fuck it, I figured, it was exciting to be asked. And I needed a place for my jet engine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was sitting with Yoni on the cement steps, mid-cigarette, when the Festiva pulled up. It was summer, late afternoon. The little car parked across the street and a two-hundred-pound man stepped out, dressed entirely in black: dress shirt, shoes, bandanna, slacks-much too hot for the day. "Coming from work," the man said by way of explanation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What are you, a ninja?" I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was a friend of Yoni's, it turned out, and they went in the house to chat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as they were inside he asked, "Who's she?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He made me a mixtape of rap songs. On our first date, we drank whiskey under a bridge. He left me little notes in his tiny lowercase script that said, i like your face and if we're careful, we could do this for life. I slept at his house most nights, listening in on the 3 a.m. recording sessions in the basement. I went to all of the Doomtree rap shows, sweating along with the other fifty attendees at a grimy basement club. Each member of the crew had his own brand of charisma; they were funny and angry and impulsive and a little bit sad and their show was always one second away from falling apart completely-like they were rounding a corner, up on two wheels, for the whole set.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the day my boyfriend and I rode around running errands in the Festiva. He kept a long list in his head of the people he knew and the things they might want; this index allowed him to barter for items that he himself wanted but couldn't afford. He knew, for example, that the clerks at the record shop would be hungry mid-shift. He knew that his friend at the sandwich shop could hook up free meals when managers weren't around. So if he gave the sandwich friend free passes to the next Doomtree show, he could get some bagged lunches, which he would then deliver to the record shop in exchange for a copy of the limited-edition twelve-inch that hit shelves yesterday but cost more than he had on hand. He didn't feed meters. He signed his credit card slips Punk Rock. He broke every rule-with a flourish. And everyone seemed to love him in spite, or maybe because, of it. I'd had boyfriends before, but falling in love with him felt like converting to a new worldview-where almost anything was possible and almost nothing was mandatory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the car, he played me all sorts of underground hip-hop: Vast Aire and Sage Francis, acts signed to indie labels like Def Jux and Anticon, and local groups like Traditional Methods. He played some hardcore punk too, from bands with names I can't remember. My formative experience as a rapper happened in his Festiva, idling in the parking lot of an Old Country Buffet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was behind the wheel, I sat shotgun. He put a beat on the stereo. "Alright, rap."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Man, I really don't want to do this." I hadn't written many lyrics yet and was painfully self-conscious about performing them in front of someone so good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You gotta just do it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm too shy with you right here."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Okay." He opened his door. "Roll down your window a little."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He left the car, came around to my side, and started pounding a beat on the metal roof above my head.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I started a verse, quietly at first, then louder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He listened through the cracked window.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was done, he got back in the car. It was good, he said. He thought I had real promise. But, "Why don't you rap like you write?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My rap verses were mostly just lightweight wordplay. My essays, some of which he'd read, were different: they had extended metaphors, literary allusions, subtext. It had never occurred to me to try to write rap like that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Later, back at the Doomtree house, he helped me count bars properly. There are two snares in every bar, he explained. Then he explained what a snare was.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first Doomtree producer to let me write a song over his production was MK Larada. He was one of the more reserved members of the group, with fair hair, a sharp tongue, a blazing intellect, his own frequent dark moods, and a slight tic when he was onto a strong creative idea. He became one of my closest friends. Drinking into the early hours of the morning, we recorded a song that would be called "Hawks &amp; Herons" in the Doomtree basement. I realized I'd fallen asleep at the microphone only when my beer hit the floor and woke me up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Within a year or so of meeting them, the Doomtree guys sat me down in their living room. In a sea of crushed cans and brimming ashtrays, they officially asked me to join the group. This did not feel like a job offer; it felt like being asked to join an expedition that would last many years, maybe my whole life. They were my brothers now and I was their sister. Giddy, I called my mother to share the news. She asked what a Doomtree was. I told her. She warned me to watch out for cocaine. "Mom. We don't have any money for cocaine." We could barely afford flyers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe because there are no major labels based in Minneapolis, a DIY ethic prevails. Doomtree didn't have a manager or a publicist or a booking agent-not all of us even had phone numbers. So Lazerbeak handled the money; Sims sorted out merchandise manufacturing; Paper Tiger and MK Larada designed the CDs and posters; I helped write artist bios and press releases. We all met once a week to scheme on the next big show or recording project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today's conventional wisdom says that the best way to live a life is to keep all the components partitioned-love, money, friends. You're not supposed to date your boss, or go bowling with your analyst, or borrow large sums of money from your drinking buddies. We think of ourselves as a store-bought cake with a sheet of wax paper separating all the slices so that they never touch: neat, single servings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But hanging out with Doomtree, it was all one thing-social, professional, romantic. I did all of it with the same people and often at the same time. There were no hobbies and no off-hours, no work-life balance; there was just writing songs and walking to SuperAmerica for cigarettes and drafting set lists and drinking with the guys and making album budgets and goofing off and collapsing into sleep tucked into the leopard print of my boyfriend's left shoulder. None of it came apart from the rest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On stage, we were still a mess, and that was part of the magic. Someone was always bleeding into his microphone or trying to catch the mixer before the bass rattled it off the table and crashed it to the floor. The precariousness of the live show was like a watermark that proved to the audience it was all real: we hadn't rehearsed these moments, choreographed these feelings-that was not a staged fall, that was just a fall-fall. I sweat through my clothes with the rest of the guys, full of whiskey and adrenaline and youth and anger. Stage was a place for all of the outsized feelings that didn't fit neatly into daily life. You can't scream in love or fury in line at the Walgreens pharmacy; you can't roughhouse with grown men at the post office; and you can't calmly explain to your parents that you'd rather sleep outside, under a stranger's hedge, than in your own bed. But with a little songcraft, those dark moods were perfect grist for performance-we rattled up the biggest feelings in one another, and anyone else close enough to hear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We started getting some good press, building a decent draw. While the whole group often performed together, we played and recorded individually too. Everyone was both a member of the crew and a solo artist. My boyfriend released an album, strong enough to get picked up for rerelease by a larger label called Rhymesayers. Soon his rate of ascent started to outpace the rest of ours. He was getting real gigs, more money, legitimate interviews in shiny magazines. He started touring regularly, and landed a spot on a full North American routing, where he got to travel on a tour bus with a couch and video games in the back. He was gone for many weeks at a time. And was excited to be away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Back in Minneapolis, I was earning some accolades too. But I still wasn't supporting myself on music, and there was no clear indicator that I ever could. Rappers are like violinists or gymnasts: they start when they're knee-high and they're famous before they can rent a car. In my midtwenties I was old enough to be a retired rapper, moving into comedic movies.</p></p><h2>Ready Common Core 3 Mathematics Instruction</h2><p>Grade 3 Common Core mathematics instruction book.

Although Godinho's life is largely a mystery and his text was never published, today his manuscript of utmost relevance in the study of Renaissance Iberian fencing, since it is the only complete treatise discovered so far describing the "Common" or "Vulgar" style of Iberian fencing, first documented in the 15th century, but by Godinho's day, displaced by the new system of La Verdadera Destreza. The work includes instructions for the single sword, a long-bladed, cut &amp; thrust weapon taught alone and with the use of the shield, buckler, dagger, and cape, as well as paired with a second sword. Godinho's instructions also includes the longest known text on the use of the montante, or two-handed sword, a devastating weapon that was used by soldiers and body-guards, in duels and battlefields, in crowded streets and aboard galleys. Translator Tim Rivera provides a detailed introduction that explains Godinho's relationship to earlier masters of the "Common School" of swordsmanship, and a short primer on the various weapons, guards, parries, footwork and terminology of the tradition.</p><p>Tim Rivera has been researching, studying, and translating texts on Spanish swordplay since 2008, concentrating on the older and common styles from the 15th - 17th century.

But Jaime Segura isn&#x2019;t there on a homicidal mission, and he&#x2019;s just as scared as those whose lives he holds as collateral. As an armed police presence builds outside the school&#x2019;s gates, the only person Jaime will talk to is Ben Whistler, an MI6 accountant who worked with Jaime&#x2019;s lover, Miro. Miro&#x2019;s gone missing, along with a quarter of a billion pounds allotted for reconstruction work in Iraq. Jaime refuses to believe that Miro is a thief&#x2014;though he&#x2019;s always had his secrets. But then, so does Louise, so do the other hostages&#x2014;and so do some people on the outside, who&#x2019;d much rather Jaime was silenced.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p><b>Mick Herron</b>&nbsp;is a British novelist and short story writer who was born in Newcastle and studied English at Oxford.

Morning is broken. In the real world, you simply reach a slow hand out and depress the button so the ringing stops. And for the moment it takes this to happen, you&#x2019;re held between two worlds: the dream life in which mallets are hidden under pillows by pyjama-clad animals, and the default waking mode in which you blink twice, remember who you are, and feel detail seep back into you the way light infiltrates the room&#x2014;you&#x2019;re Louise Kennedy, you&#x2019;re thirty-two years old, and today is either the first day of the rest of your life or the last day of your old one, depending on how things work out. It&#x2019;s Tuesday, April 3rd. The weather&#x2019;s set for fair. Sunlight has already reached the bedspread, drawing upon it a range of shadow mountains whose outcrops and valleys exactly match the folds and ridges of the curtaintops. It&#x2019;s time to get up. It&#x2019;s time to get up. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Louise muffles a sigh, and pulls herself out of bed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6:45.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where it begins.<br>And this, too, is where it begins; an hour earlier, and some five miles from Louise&#x2019;s bed: in a grey lay-by, shielded from the A40 by a row of gasping trees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This stretch of the road, this time of the morning, most traffic is headed the other way; the first leg of the pilgrimage into London, hauling workers on to the motorway and firing them through the chalk cutting on the county border, where red kites ride the thermals overhead; then on past the redaubed stretch of graffiti (<i>Why</i> <i>do I </i>still <i>do this every day?</i>) to the stilted Westway and the congestion-charged canyons beyond. But George Trebor&#x2019;s on the homeward leg of the Lille/Birmingham run, and this lay-by is where he parked overnight; partly because the legislation won&#x2019;t let him ply his sixteen-wheeled trade twelve hours at a stretch; partly because there&#x2019;s a loo here; but mostly because the back of his cab&#x2019;s a fine and private place, unlike a two-up/two-down containing three teenage boys and a harassed wife. Which is maybe why he&#x2019;s overslept, and is still in the cab sorting out shaving gear when a car pulls off the road, passes his rig, and parks outside the brick toilet. There&#x2019;s another truck behind George&#x2019;s but nothing in front, so he has a clear view of the car, which is a dark blue BMW with two occupants, neither of whom emerges. They&#x2019;re both male. No clue as to what they&#x2019;re doing: checking a map, maybe. Drawing straws to see who takes the first leak.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#x2019;s when he sees the boy coming out of the toilet.<br>Most days, Louise played the radio softly during breakfast; the <i>Today</i> programme, or&#x2014;if reality pressed too heavily on her&#x2014;Radio 2. This morning, though, she opted for silence, or what passed for it in this stretch of South Oxford, where the early morning hum from the railside works plugged any gaps left by the Abingdon Road traffic. Her kitchen window looked out on a meadow&#x2014;the Ham&#x2014;beyond which lay the railway line, where Railtrack operated a pick-and-mix gravel concession, or that&#x2019;s what it looked like. Trucks and what the Darlings called digger lorries shunted to and fro around it from the early hours, their diesel-powered belching blunted by an eight-foot baffle without which&#x2014;presumably&#x2014;everything would have been much noisier. It was part of the background hum, and throbbed beneath the morning like the area&#x2019;s heartbeat. Louise was barely conscious of it; was utterly irony-free in choosing radio silence. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, she wasn&#x2019;t at liberty to make noise these days.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bedroom above the kitchen&#x2014;there were two bedrooms in this almost comically narrow house, whose front door opened directly on to the living room&#x2014;had, until lately, been the other bedroom; the one that wasn&#x2019;t Louise&#x2019;s. And now it had become her mother&#x2019;s bedroom instead; that M attaching to other to produce a wholly opposite shade, the way dawn changes to dusk, one letter at a time&#x2014;down, mown, moon, moot, most, must, musk . . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above her head her mother slept, while Louise prepared breakfast in silence.<br><br>The boy saw the BMW and came to a halt, middle of the lay-by. George Trebor, watching for no special reason&#x2014;except that&#x2019;s what you did, watch, when something was happening&#x2014;had a plain view of this; enough to realize that already, even before he was fully aware of paying witness, his version had come askew from reality. Because this wasn&#x2019;t a boy, precisely. More like twenty&#x2014;bumfluffed rather than bearded, but beyond the point at which the mouth seems too big for the head; the nose too small for the face. He was dark-skinned, and looked, George thought, exhausted&#x2014;like the next big wind would blow him away. He wore jeans and a dark green bomber jacket, and a rucksack hung from his left shoulder; he grasped its strap with his left hand, while his right was thrust into his pocket. No: it hung from his right shoulder, and all those details were reversed. George had trouble with left/right when applying them to someone facing him. Anyway, middle of the lay-by, halfway to the car, the young man stopped and dropped his head to one side, as if assessing the occupants. Working the rent, was George&#x2019;s appraisal. He himself had worked the roads long enough to be unshocked by the probability. Working the rent: but Jesus, kid, you really don&#x2019;t want to be getting into a car with two men. Any professional sex situation involving two on one: you&#x2019;ll be torn apart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe that&#x2019;s what the boy was thinking. Either way, he moved no closer to the car. Looked, in fact, kind of scared.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George wasn&#x2019;t even pretending he wasn&#x2019;t watching now, but it wasn&#x2019;t like anybody knew. Height of the cab, he might have been sitting in the royal box. The boy wasn&#x2019;t looking his way anyway; his eyes were fixed on the car, and his lips moving&#x2014;saying what, George couldn&#x2019;t tell: might have been a price-tag; might have been a name.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car door opened, and one of the men stepped out.<br>Elsewhere, alarm clocks weren&#x2019;t necessary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliot Pedlar lay on his back, eyes open, and listened to family life unfolding along the corridor&#x2014;his wife&#x2019;s happy murmur; his children&#x2019;s giggling&#x2014;the way it did every morning. The children were awake by six&#x2014;hell, six was a <i>good</i> day&#x2014;and two seconds after their first stirring, Christine was out of bed and through the door; his last glimpse of her, the flash of a dimly remembered bottom under a solely functional nightie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The wheels on the bus&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;go round and round round and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;round round and rou&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;nd the wheels on the bus go&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Round and round. Sometimes he couldn&#x2019;t tell where his sons&#x2019; voices broke off; where his wife&#x2019;s began. As if, together, they formed a perfect circle, outside of which he was always hovering; going round and round, without ever breaking in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The twins were nearly four; his wife almost exactly three decades older. And he couldn&#x2019;t tell them apart? That wasn&#x2019;t cute so much as kind of disturbing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was 6:50. He had time for another ten minutes&#x2019; sleep, but his chances of achieving it were zero.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waking thoughts were supposed to be creative thoughts&#x2014;the hinterland of dreams was where consciousness dipped into the myth kitty, and pulled out useful images. That was the theory, but actually he&#x2019;d woken up drenched in the Memory again&#x2014;the Memory being less of a series of mental pictures tied to emotions than an actual physical state he&#x2019;d been imprisoned in for almost a week . . . His right hand reached for his cock. His eyes remained fixed on the ceiling. Chris bustled into the room. &#x201c;Are you still okay to do the boys this morning?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliot eased both hands from under the duvet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You hadn&#x2019;t forgotten?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgetting wasn&#x2019;t his problem, recently. Remembering was what was driving him crazy.<br>And then there was Judy . . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a clock-radio on Judy&#x2019;s bedside table, which was paid for. When she opened her eyes, it read 6:55. Waking&#x2014;coming round to what the clock said&#x2014;was the usual brutal infraction: a list to be ticked off&#x2014;what the world owed Judy; what Judy owed the world. The equation always weighed heavy on her side of the maths. The world should know this by now, but feigned ignorance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judith Ainsworth turned the radio off, and dragged herself out of bed. The light creeping through the curtains pointed out her surroundings&#x2019; imperfections, but then it always did.<br><i>I don&#x2019;t want to be a burden.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#x2019;re not a burden, mum. I like having you here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#x2019;t let me stop you doing what you want to do.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don&#x2019;t. Honest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you thought about getting some nice ornaments for that mantelpiece? It&#x2019;s a bit bare.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Louise lived in fear of returning home to find an unacceptable ceramic the new centrepiece of her living room: a thank-you gift it would be impossible to overthrow.)<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won&#x2019;t be with you longer than I have to be.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And how did Louise respond to that? Which meant what, anyway? That death was so imminent there was little point in Louise increasing the milk order? Or that her mother, Susan, would be heading home soon; the heart attack filed away under Unpleasantnesses We Don&#x2019;t Talk About, Thank You Very Much?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Louise buttered toast, and wondered whether not putting the radio on was because she didn&#x2019;t want to hear it, or because she didn&#x2019;t want to disturb her mother<i> (I don&#x2019;t mind you listening to the radio in the morning, dear. It doesn&#x2019;t wake me)</i>. You were always ten years old when you were watching TV with your parents and a sex scene erupted. And you were always prone to the most painful guilts when your mother told you what she didn&#x2019;t mind: <i>Go on and rip my heart out, Louise. Trample it into the carpet. I don&#x2019;t mind. It&#x2019;s been attacked once already.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave up on her toast. There were more important aspects to breakfast. Fishing the back door key from its hook, she let herself into the yard&#x2014;twelve square feet of cracked, uneven paving, hemmed by a low wall bordering the Ham&#x2014;and lit a cigarette; the first of her daily pair. Giving up had never been a problem for Louise; it was only the first and last of the day she had trouble forgoing. Those were the two she&#x2019;d hung on to when she&#x2019;d discarded the habit, along with her previous job, a lover, her London flat, cocaine bingeing, and the sense she&#x2019;d somehow&#x2014;it didn&#x2019;t have a name, this feeling; was simply a cloud that descended in the early hours&#x2014;that she&#x2019;d somehow fucked up everything, even if from the outside it had looked like she was fast-tracked to the glittering prizes. Not smoking between the bracketing pair was made easier by the fact that she rarely smoked in public. Secrecy (she preferred to consider it discretion) was something she&#x2019;d had to learn anyway. Her lover, for instance, had been her married boss.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who today, of all days, was likely to weigh heavy on her mind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resting a palm on the wall, Louise looked out across the meadow. Mist curled round the trees at its farthest edge, but it would be fine later&#x2014;this was a simple rule: days you felt low were likely to shine, just to make you feel worse. Besides, this had been the pattern lately; mist giving way to bright warm weather.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smoked her cigarette to its filter, and dabbed it out on a mossed-over patch of brick. One tiny coal survived its bludgeoning, until a gust of wind whipped it out of existence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was 7:14.</p><h2>Lost Lhasa: Heinrich Harrer&#39;s Tibet</h2><p>A visual sequel to Heinrich Harrer&#39;s great travel and adventure classic Seven Years in Tibet. These photographs--most never before published--provide a unique record of life in and around Tibet&#39;s capital city of Lhasa as it can never be seen again, when Tibetan society was still innocent of other 20th-century cultures. Bibliography; index. 200 illustrations.</p><p>In the 1940s, Austrian mountain climber Heinrich Harrer escaped from a British internment camp in India and walked across the Himalayas. He limped into Lhasa two years later, and spent five years there as an honorary Tibetan. He kept diaries, bartered for an old Leica camera, and took thousands of pictures. Then in 1950 the Chinese invaded Tibet and Harrer fled. <i>Seven Years in Tibet</i> tells that story, but Harrer wanted to do more to raise international awareness. The result is <i>Lost Lhasa</i>, a collection of hundreds of previously unpublished intimate photographs of the Lhasa that used to be. With an explanatory text written in the same unpretentious prose that made <i>Seven Years</i> so popular, this paean to the Lhasa Harrer knew is beautiful and irreplaceable.This collection of 200 photos and thematically ordered essays conjures up life in an isolated, innocent Tibet before the Chinese invasion of the 1950s. Though he presents himself humbly, Harrer (author of the 1953 classic Seven Years in Tibet) is clearly remarkable: a celebrated Austrian mountaineer who escaped a British prison camp to enter Tibet in 1944, he learned the language, developed a friendship with the Dalai Lama (then a teenager), worked on the country's reforestation and helped build Lhasa's sewer system. His black-and-white photos, though occasionally grainy or mundane, capture the uncommon tapestry of Tibet: hatted servants leading the horses of government ministers, the Dalai Lama's formidable but kind mother, two honorees at a New Year's celebration clad in huge fur caps and Russian brocade robes. Harrer's photos are complemented by brief essays on such aspects of Tibetan culture as its penchant for irreverent street songs; its pilgrims' arduous rites; and its appreciation of the national drink, butter tea, which purportedly replenishes the body's stores of salt, fat and water. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Wallflower 15: Yamatonadeshiko Shichihenge</h2><p>Four handsome friends are allowed to live in a mansion for free provided that they transform the owner&#39;s wallflower niece, who breaks into nosebleeds whenever she sees somebody attractive, into a lady within three years.</p><p></p><h2>The Last Whistle: Ocean Shore Railroad</h2><p>Lavishly illustrated history of the Ocean Shore Railroad which ran down the California coast until supplanted by Route 1.</p><p></p><h2>77 Dream Songs</h2><p>Faber are pleased to announce the relaunch of the poetry list - starting in Spring 2001 and continuing, with publication dates each month, for the rest of the year.

Both books firmly anchor the art in the life-context and experiences of the artist, thus allowing the reader to chart clearly his thematic and stylistic development. Belkin (an editor of The Letters of Peter Paul Rubens, Northwestern Univ., 1991) sets the stage for a discussion of Rubens by explaining the political and religious divisions in the Netherlands and by examining his early family life. She traces Rubens's visit to Italy, where he immersed himself in the works of Titian, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Correggio, and then follows him to Antwerp, where he was both a full-fledged painter and a diplomat in good stead with the major courts of Europe. She does a marvelous job of tracking the progression of Rubens's artistic, allegorical, and iconographic content. The author also posits Rubens as a disillusioned diplomat who saw and portrayed women as peace-bearers in an age of turmoil. Bohm-Duchen (Understanding Modern Art, EDC Pubs., 1991) uses the flow of information since glasnost to flesh out the social, religious, and cultural context of Chagall's development as an artist. Although he preferred to be known as an intuitive "tabula rasa," Chagall's Russian-Jewish upbringing; his travels to Paris, Berlin, Palestine, and the United States; and his witness to two world wars greatly affected his work. The historical background Bohm-Duchen gives here can lead toward a better understanding of Chagall's art, but her Chagall is not as fully revealed as Belkin's Rubens. His persona still floats, unmoored, like the Green Violinist against the stark white background of the book's front cover. Based on their price and scope, both books are recommended for public and academic libraries.ANadine Dalton Speidel, Cuyahoga Cty.

His Civil War paintings and limited edition prints hang in the finest collections in the country and are noted by collectors from around the world. Now, in Don Troiani&#39;s Regiments and Uniforms of the Civil War, the artist turns his brush to one of the most colorful and captivating aspects of Civil War history: the individual units that earned their reputations on the battlefield and the distinctive uniforms they wore. In addition to 130 paintings of battle scenes and individual figures, the book also includes more than 250 full-color photographs of the uniforms the soldiers wore and the accouterments they carried. Supporting the illustrations is text by two of the leading military artifact experts. Taken together, it makes for one of the most comprehensive books on Civil War uniforms ever undertaken</p><p>Don Troiani attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and New York City&#39;s Art Students League. His artwork is in numerous major collections, including American Heritage magazine, the National Park Service, the U. S.

His specialty is the Civil War, and this, the third book showcasing his artwork, has 380 color illustrations, including 250 photos of uniforms and associated gear, and 130 reproductions of Troiani's paintings. Many pictures are of individual soldiers, highlighting the wide variety of uniforms worn by soldiers of both sides, while others show the troops in battle.

Their inventiveness and variety are overwhelming, and their durability is uncanny. Some children's games still current today were played when Rome was young. Minor details may change, the words of the jingles change, but the games remain basically the same from one generation to the next. Also, children's games reflect with great accuracy both current and past situations, providing a good index to the folkways of a certain time and place.<br>This book is the pioneer study in American children's games. It contains scores of games that the author collected throughout the eastern half of the United States around the turn of the century. It is the basic book in the field, for much of the material has disappeared since Newell collected it. Of course this book can never be superseded, since this particular moment in time is gone and cannot be retrieved.<br>Newell, who was one of America's foremost folklorists, has described the procedure of the games, and quoted collected texts of the songs in full, with the music for them in many cases. He also provides comparative material demonstrating the kinship between the game under discussion and similar games from other cultures. Over 100 games are given here under various functional categories: guessing games, games of chase, ball games, knife games, and many others.<br>The book has great value for modern readers. It is also an important document for the folklorist, since most of this material is not obtainable elsewhere. It is valuable to historians as a source of information on popular culture. It is useful to parents, teachers, and any others who may want suggestions for games and entertainments for children. And for the general reader it will bring back many a golden memory of the days when he, too, played "London Bridge is falling down."<br></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>The Sailor of the Seas of Fate (Elric Series)</h2><p>Forced to flee his city of Melnibone, Elric and his sorcerous blade Stormbringer journey through barren hills to the edge of a black sea.

One of the major results to be sought, whether in magical training, in meditation, or for the matter of that in psychotherapy, is to push back the misty boundaries of unconsciousness, both higher and lower. That achieved, the conscious mind is more widely able to recognise the influences which affect it, to understand them and very frequently control them, and so is able to take more intelligent responsibility in the life of the person. In this book, the keys to this process as employed in the initiatory rites of the Order Aurum Solis are revealed in detail for the first time. These ceremonies of initiation, together with inner magical techniques required for proper performance of the works, are capable of leading the aspirant from the portal of the mysteries to the heights of magical attainment. The structure and consecration of an Aurum Solis temple are likewise presented, together with details of vestments and regalia; and the major inner symbolism of the Ogdoadic Tradition of the Western Mysteries is set forth. This significant work, prepared by the Grand Master of the Order, is a full and vital revelation of the outer and inner initiatory technology of the Aurum Solis, and stands as a guide to the magical potential and the power of the Ogdoadic Tradition.</p><p></p><h2>Second Hand: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>Richard, the owner of a secondhand store ("Satori Junk") just outside Detroit, finds his life changing all at once when his mother dies and he rummages in her basement for good junk. He meets Theresa, a thrift-attired junk goddess who shares his feelings for castaways, and he falls for her&#x2015;hard.</strong></p> At last, the novel for everyone who has ever loved something secondhand&#x2015;the High Fidelity of garage sales, the On the Road of thrift shopping, The Moviegoer of the flea market. Richard owns a secondhand store ("Satori Junk") just outside Detroit. He's the kind of guy for whom not much happens, until it happens all at once: His mother dies. He rummages his parents' basement for good junk and finds (alongside "every purse my mother has ever owned since the Fifties") a box of photos that changes his view of everything. He falls apart over his mother's notes on his favorite meal in an old cookbook. He meets Theresa, a fellow hipster, a thrift-attired junk goddess who shares his feeling for castaways, and he falls for her&#x2015;hard. Along the way he acquires some junk wisdom about love and loss. Richard's inimitable, hilarious, philosophical, self-deprecating, yearning voice, and his sharp and loving eye for common foibles and unexpected virtues make for a comic novel crammed full of surprise and pleasure. Second Hand is peppered with insight as unpretentious and satisfying as the unexpected garage sale find. Junk, Richard tells us, "has taught me that to find new use for an object discarded is an act of glistening purity. I have learned that a camera case makes a damn fine purse or that 40 copies of 'Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass's Whipped Cream and Other Delights' may be used to cover a wall of a bedroom. . . . Junk has taught me that all will come to junk eventually, and much sooner than you think."</p><p><i>"In the junk business, we collect the ugly with the beautiful, the bizarre with the elegant, the valuable with the worthless, sometimes forgetting which is which, or intentionally inverting them."</i><p> The speaker is Richard, a.k.a. "Junk," the proprietor of Satori Junk in Detroit, Michigan, and also the protagonist of Michael Zadoorian's terrific first novel, <i>Second Hand</i>. As the novel opens, Richard is facing a crisis in his life: his mother is dying of cancer and he and his sister are already disagreeing about how to handle the estate. When mom finally passes on, brother and sister begin a tug of war over her belongings that's as much about philosophy as it is about taste: </p><blockquote> "Richard dear," Linda says, in her mock-sincere voice, touching my hand, not in a warm way, but a way calculated to make me feel some sibling obligation, "I don't really care if things get a good home. I would just like to be done with all this. I'd like to get rid of this stuff, sell the house and get on with my life." </blockquote> Richard, on the other hand, <i>does</i> care, and begins a careful excavation of the "junk" his parents left behind. At the same time, he meets Theresa, an eccentric young woman with a horrific job: putting animals to sleep at the local humane society. Though the theme of unwanted animals as junk isn't exactly subtle, Zadoorian doesn't belabor the point, choosing instead to focus on the terrible toll that Theresa's work takes on her personal life. <p> As Richard and Theresa's relationship becomes both more intimate and more complicated, each takes refuge in private obsessions. For Richard, it is the history of his parents' marriage as revealed by the things they left behind; for Theresa, it is the Mexican Day of the Dead, whose promise of forgiveness alternately tempts and torments her. There's breaking up, making up, and a little philosophizing in between as these two junkyard lovers navigate the rocky road to romance, but Zadoorian does a terrific job of seamlessly weaving all the disparate threads into his narrative. By turns comic and wrenching, <i>Second Hand</i> builds incrementally to an emotional wallop that is as unexpected as it is effective. As Richard and Theresa finally realize their own true value in each others' eyes, Richard remarks, "our lives are lived in these moments, certain seconds here and there, snapshots only we can see and remember, in the way only we can remember them. They are the bric-a-brac of our lives." In the end, junk proves the perfect medium for Zadoorian to explore his characters' emotional lives. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Richard sees treasure everywhere. In that old eight-track quadraphonic stereo, that pink granite bowling ball, or a Niagara Falls napkin holder. While most people scramble for the newest and the best, Richard searches for the odd and obsolete -- and sells it at his second-hand shop on the edge of Detroit. <br>Why does he do it? For Richard, junk is a way of life, a calling, and a passion. Until his comfortable second-hand life gets a first-hand jolt. <br>Richard's mother has died, and left behind a valuable house full of packed-away junk -- including some old photos that will change everything Richard thought about his parents. And then there's the hip, thrift-attired woman who comes into his store with more than junk on her mind.... Suddenly some very unexpected things are entering Richard's life, including some surprising revelations about love and loss -- and what's really important in life. <br>With an unerring blend of the comic and the poignant, Michael Zadoorian has written an unforgettable novel about knick-knacks, garage sales, romance, and the bonds we form with people and things -- the perfect story for anyone who has ever loved something second hand.<br></p><h2>The Harder They Come: A Novel</h2><p><p>Acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author T.C.

Boyle&#x2019;s worldview and authorial skill to say that, while <em>The Harder They Come</em> is not always a taut narrative, it is a book that embraces the reader and takes him where he&#x2019;s supposed to go. After opening with a tightly-plotted set piece (in which one of three main characters kills a local bandit after his cruise ship lands in Costa Rica), the novel settles down into a more leisurely pace. We are introduced to Sten, a seventy-year-old former marine (he killed the bandit), who lives in Mendocino County, California with his wife Carolee. He&#x2019;s not particularly proud of what he did in Costa Rica, even if it garners him a little local acclaim. Sten is more concerned about his twenty-something son, Adam, who calls himself Colter after the real-life, wilderness-inhabiting guide for Lewis and Clark. Adam/Colter, who is living in the woods and descending into some serious mental health issues, has taken up with Sara Jennings, a fortyish woman inclined toward libertarianism. The other thing that Sten is concerned about is a group of local drug mules who are poisoning the forest around his community and generally raising havoc. These concerns conspire to lift the pace of the novel around the midpoint, where violence starts its inevitable creep back into the story. Reading <em>The Harder They Come</em> works on two levels&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a fun, thoughtful novel and it&#x2019;s a darker rumination on the intersection between the myth of the west and the reality of it. This is an enjoyable novel that balances story with big ideas. The more I think about it, the more in awe I am of Boyle&#x2019;s talent.<em> &#x2013; Chris Schluep</em></p><p>A <em>NEWSWEEK</em> BEST NOVEL OF THE YEAR</p><p>A TOP 10 BOOK OF 2015 (Michiko Kakutani, <em>New York Times</em>)</p><p>Set in contemporary Northern California, <em>The Harder They Come</em> explores the volatile connections between three damaged people&#x2014;an aging Vietnam veteran, his psychologically unstable son, and the son&#x2019;s paranoid, much older lover&#x2014;as they careen toward an explosive confrontation.</p><p>On a cruise to Central America, seventy-year-old Sten Stensen kills an armed robber menacing a busload of tourists.

In this book Dr Russell shows the developments in the understanding of the character and function of these figures as they appear from the pseudepigrapha. He begins by looking at developments related to his theme in Philo and Josephus, the rabbinic literature and the Dead Sea scrolls. He then goes on to consider Adam, Enoch and Noah, Daniel, Job, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs, Moses and Ezra, and then the &#39;lives&#39; of the prophets and the eschatological prophets. Now that the importance of Jewish literature of this period is increasingly understood and texts are more easily accessible, this new study will be found particularly useful for seeing familiar figures of the Old Testament not just through perspectives shaped by Christian tradition or modern historical criticism, but as they were seen by Jews at the time when they were written. D. S. Russell was formerly General Secretary of the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland. He has specialized in studies of this period.</p><p></p><h2>Handbook of Shortshell Reloading</h2><p>Includes: Directory of manufacturers, reloading habits and safety, choosing the right reloading tool, how to select components, choosing a load, introduction to loading data, cleaning and fun with your shotgun and more.</p><p></p><h2>Don&#39;t Die, My Love</h2><p>Julie Ellis and Luke Muldenhower have always been school sweethearts.

This trend threatens America's competitive edge and the conduct of free markets everywhere. <br><br> An expert on the intersection of economics and politics, Ian Bremmer has followed the rise of state-owned firms in China, Russia, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Iran, Venezuela, and elsewhere. He demonstrates the growing challenge that state capitalism will pose for the entire global economy. <br><br> Among the questions addressed: Are we on the brink of a new kind of Cold War, one that pits competing economic systems in a battle for dominance? Can free market countries compete with state capitalist powerhouses over relations with countries that have elements of both systems-like India, Brazil, and Mexico? Does state capitalism have staying power? <br><br> This guide to the next big global economic trend includes useful insights for investors, business leaders, policymakers, and anyone who wants to understand important emerging changes in international politics and the global economy.</p><p><strong>Nouriel Roubini and Ian Bremmer: Author One-to-One</strong> <br> In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together authors Nouriel Roubini and Ian Bremmer and asked them to interview each other. <br> <br> <strong>Nouriel Roubini</strong> is a professor of economics at New York University's Stern School of Business. He has extensive senior policy experience in the federal government, having served from 1998 to 2000 in the White House and the U.S. Treasury. He is the founder and chairman of RGE Monitor (rgemonitor.com), an economic and financial consulting firm, regularly attends and presents his views at the World Economic Forum at Davos and other international forums, and is an adviser to cental bankers around the world. He is the author of <em>Crisis Economics</em> and <em>Bailouts or Bail-Ins</em>. Read on to see Nouriel Roubini's questions for Ian Bremmer, or turn the tables to see what Bremmer asked Roubini. <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: Your book [<i>The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations?</i>] suggests that an old trend, what you call state capitalism, has become much more important. What happened to change things? <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: Over the past 18 months, the Western financial crisis and the global recession have accelerated the inevitable transition from a G7 to a G20 world. That&#x2019;s not just a matter of more states at the bargaining table. It&#x2019;s not just about having to herd more cats to get things done on the international stage. It&#x2019;s about herding cats together with other animals that don&#x2019;t really like cats. And that&#x2019;s not really herding. <br> <br> The G7 world was one where everyone that mattered for growth in the global economy accepted the assumption that prosperity depended on rule of law, independent courts, transparency and a free media&#x2014;and in the value of free market capitalism. In that world, multinational corporations are the principle economic heavyweights. This consensus has provided the engine driving globalization for the past 40 years. <br> <br> The sun has set on that world. The country that has emerged strongest and fastest from the global slowdown is one that does not accept the idea that a regulated free market economy is crucial for sustainable economic growth. China&#x2019;s success has persuaded authoritarians around the world that they really can have explosive growth without undermining their monopoly hold on domestic political power. China has enjoyed double-digit growth for thirty years without freedom of speech, without well-established economic rules of the road, without judges that can ignore political pressure, without credible property rights&#x2014;without democracy. And the events of the past 18 months have made China more important that ever for the future of global economic growth. This is a big change with enormous implications that we had better start thinking through. <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: The term state capitalism means different things to different people. How do you explain it today? <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: I&#x2019;m writing about a system in which the state uses the power of markets primarily for political gain. A country&#x2019;s political leaders know that command economies will eventually fail, but they&#x2019;re afraid that if they allow space for markets that are truly free, they&#x2019;ll lose control of how wealth is generated. They could end up empowering others who will use markets to generate revenue that can then be used to challenge the government&#x2019;s authority to dominate the country&#x2019;s political life. So they use national oil companies, other state-owned enterprises, privately owned but politically loyal national champion companies, and sovereign wealth funds to exercise as much control as possible over the creation of wealth within the country&#x2019;s borders. And they send these companies and investment fund abroad to secure deals that increase the state&#x2019;s political and geopolitical leverage in a variety of ways. <br> <br> This system is fundamentally incompatible with a free market system. <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: Creating friction between the state capitalists and other governments. To say nothing of privately owned companies. <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: Exactly, yes. In a free market system, multinational corporations are looking to maximize profits. In markets that are not intelligently regulated, and we&#x2019;ve seen this in the United States, they're looking to maximize short-term gains at the expense of sustainable, long-term growth for their shareholders or for their own compensation. The past two years have reminded us of the sometime excesses of free market capitalism. <br> <br> In a state capitalist system-- the principle economic actors are looking first to achieve political goals. Profits are subordinate to that goal. In other words, if profits serve the state&#x2019;s interests, they&#x2019;ll pursue profits. But if the state needs a state-owned oil company to pay through the nose to lock up long-term supplies to the oil, gas, metals and minerals needed to secure the long-term growth that keeps workers in their jobs, off the streets, and the political leaders in power, profits and efficiency can become political liabilities and these companies will pay whatever it takes to get what their political patrons want. <br> <br> But the state-owned companies are competing with multinationals that won&#x2019;t overpay, that can&#x2019;t overpay. Here, the injection of politics into market activity distorts the outcome&#x2014;in this case by raising the price that we all pay for energy and other commodities. <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: When you mention the state capitalist countries, which ones do you specifically have in mind? <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: We find state capitalist powers among the Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf-- Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the most important. You see this trend, of course, in Putin&#x2019;s Russia. There are other examples of countries that mix free market with state capitalist policies. But we wouldn&#x2019;t be talking about state capitalism as game-changer for international politics and the global economy if it weren&#x2019;t for China, now the world&#x2019;s second largest economy and its fastest growing major marketplace. <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: <i>The End of the Free Market</i> is a provocative title. Are you trying to out-Doom me? <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: You know I wouldn&#x2019;t do that. But you have to admit, it&#x2019;s not an exaggeration. It&#x2019;s not that I think the United States is going to throw away its free market principles. It's not about President Obama being some kind of socialist. Washington will tighten the regulation of financial markets in coming months, and some people won&#x2019;t like that. Americans will not lose their faith in the power of free market capitalism to generate prosperity. But that can&#x2019;t be said for the rest of the world. <br> <br> The global economic system is no longer driven by consensus around these values. There are now competing forms of capitalism. You used the word friction. That&#x2019;s exactly the right word. Friction, competition, even conflict. There will be winners and losers, and the world&#x2019;s political and business leaders better begin to try to sort out who those winners and losers will be. <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: Do you mean that state capitalists will be winners and those who bank on free markets will lose? <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: Not necessarily. We&#x2019;re going to see governments around the world that no longer feel bound to follow the Western rulebook of decades past. We&#x2019;ll see multinational corporations struggling to adapt, because foreign investment will become much less predictable and much more complicated. And the backing they get from their home governments won&#x2019;t carry as much weight. <br> <br> Yet, some of them will be more successful than others at learning to compete on a playing field that isn&#x2019;t level. There are very good reasons to doubt that the state capitalists will have staying power. But for now, they have lots of new clout and plenty of advantages. Over the next five, ten, twenty years, state capitalist governments and the companies and institutions they empower will be a serious&#x2014;and global--force to be reckoned with. <br> <br> The threat for Americans is that all this is happening at a moment when people are struggling, and their elected leaders have every incentive to respond to that fear and anger with promises to throw up walls meant to protect them from all these changes. Americans have always prided themselves on tearing down walls, not building them. State capitalism and American populism will put that faith to the test. <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: Were you tempted to call your book <i>The End of Globalization?</i> <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: No, this isn&#x2019;t the end of globalization. It is the end of globalization&#x2019;s singular, overriding power to shape our lives and the future of the global economy. Globalization depends on access to global consumer markets, capital markets, and labor markets. State capitalism compromises all three. Globalization still matters, and it will continue to matter for the foreseeable future. But it is no longer the fundamental driver of growth in a global economy that looks increasingly toward China for the next expansion. <br> <br> (Photo of Nouriel Roubini � RGE Monitor)Ian Bremmer is a president of Eurasia Group, the world&#39;s leading global politcal risk research and consulting firm.

In this remarkable study, Philip Mansel richly describes the city as the capital of the Ottoman sultans, dominating an empire that at its height stretched from Morocco to Russia and from the Danube to the Persian Gulf. Beginning his story in 1453 with the triumphant entry of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, Mansel charts the dramtic influence of several wealthy dynasties through to the final fall of Constantinople to the Turkish Republic in 1924. <br> "Constantinople" brings to life a world now lost forever and records the history of what was indeed "the city of the world's desire" -- irrestible, insidious, capable of driving its inhabitants to extremes of grandeur, piety, or depravity.</p><p>Philip Mandsel&#39;s book is a five-hundred-year history of Constantinople (now Istanbul) which attempts to convey the rich history of this one-time capital city and describe the defining characteristics which point toward its potential to return to global grandeur. The book is sizable in scope and weight: there&#39;s a wealth of details and illustrations. Mandsel addresses the development of Constantinople into an Islamic city, covering the five-century dynasty of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Turks conquered the Byzantine Empire in 1453, converting the city from the capital of Eastern Orthodox Christianity to the home of sultans, eunuchs, and janizaries. They created a city of mosques and minarets that served as the Ottoman capital until the end of World War I. Mandsel&#39;s attention falls particularly on the palaces and the political history of the capital, as well as the great architectural works which still constitute the city&#39;s skyline. This is a highly readable history of the great city on the Bosporus, marked by keen perceptions of art and palace life.Philip Mansel is a historian of courts and royal dynasties. He is the author of biographies of Louis XVIII and the Prince de Ligne, The Court of France, 1789-1830, and Sultans in Splendour: The Last Years of the Ottoman World.

An eight-time Rita nominee, she's won The National Reader's Choice, The Bookseller's Best and other awards. She runs Brenda Novak for the Cure, a charity that has raised more than $2.5 million for diabetes research (her youngest son has this disease). She considers herself lucky to be a mother of five and married to the love of her life.&nbsp;www.brendanovak.com <br>Novak's personal experience with juvenile diabetes puts a poignant spin on this tale of a mother's daily struggle to care for her diabetic son while on the run from her wealthy, abusive boyfriend, Manuel. Emma Wright is armed with a new identity, a teaching degree and a couple of thousand in cash when she leaves Manuel's California mansion with her five-year-old son, Max. Unfortunately, Manuel is hot on her heels, and he has the help of powerful and shady connections. After Emma's car is stolen while she's picking up supplies at a Nevada Wal-Mart, Emma throws herself on the mercy of Preston Holman, a man she'd met briefly at a motel where she and Max were staying. Preston wants nothing to do with the pair; he's still hurting from his divorce as well as the sudden illness and subsequent death of his own young son. Inevitably, Novak's reluctant hero comes to Emma's rescue&#x2014;and becomes emotionally entangled in the process. Anyone who has seen the movies <i>Sleeping with the Enemy</i> or <i>Enough</i> will anticipate every plot twist, but Novak (<i>A Home of Her Own</i>, etc.) knows how to relate a suspenseful tale. When Emma isn't reeling from a near brush with Manuel, she's frantically trying to keep her son's blood sugar levels stable, and her almost palpable fear fuels this gripping tale. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Conroy, a freelance journalist, argues that we should take seriously Strieber's claim that alien entities are catalysts to a higher consciousness. In this rambling, overwritten yet interesting study, he pokes around in Strieber's childhood to establish credibility, analyzes his horror fiction and assesses Strieber's UFO experiences in terms of the Jungian unconscious, fairy lore and other abduction cases in which symbolic imagery figured prominently. He also examines the mixed reception accorded to Communion both by the mainstream media and within the UFO community. In an epilogue, Conroy relates his own "visitorlike" experiences. Readers who lean toward a nuts-and-bolts explanation of UFOs as extraterrestrial craft will probably feel let down. Photos. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Whitley Strieber's Communion (Morrow, 1987) and its sequel, Transformation (Morrow, 1988), are the most detailed first-person accounts about alien abduction yet written. Conroy, a freelance journalist, provides a thorough examination of the book and its claims. He delves into Strieber's family history and earlier career as a science fiction and horror novelist and discusses how readers and the mass media responded to Communion . The book's acceptance among members of the UFO community is also explored, with commentary from such authorities as Budd Hopkins, Jacques Vallee, and Philip J. Klass. Unfortunately, however, the author's objectivity is called into question by his admission that he had a similar abduction experience.

Making use of the thought of Rene Girard, the author shows how the God who was revealed by Jesus subverted the violent language, imagery and expectations of the early Christians.</p><p><b>James Alison</b>, writes, lectures and teaches in the UK, the US and Latin America and is formerly a professor of Dogmatic Theology at the Universidad Catolica Bolivia, He is an Oxford-educated theologian with an influential and growing readership on both sides of the Atlantic.Given the immense popularity and widespread influence of ReneGirard's mimetic theory of violence, this book--which is an accessible application of the theory to consideration of the eschatological imagination--is sure to find a significant audience. The book begins with a straightforward recapitulation of Girard's theory, then considers the significance of the Resurrection as "end" in the middle of time. The result is a critical perspective on human action, a turn away from reactive accounts intended to exonerate the actor for past acts of collective violence and toward a proactive account, which acknowledges participation in present acts of collective violence and grounds hope in God's act, not ours. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>Art of Soap Making (Harrowsmith Contemporary Primer)</h2><p>Merilyn Mohr has created a complete introduction to the art of home soapmaking - a craft that appeals both to our sense of economy and to our sense of simple esthetics.</p><p>Merilyn MohrForeword <p>I always feel a kind of alchemy at work when a batch of homemade soap is being made, a process that is at once deeply primitive and highly elegant. Unlike commercial soaps of today, a bar of handcrafted soap seems to have a character and richness of its own, and from the strange and streaked concoction my first landlady grated into her washtub to the herbal bar I washed with this morning, handmade soap has never failed to excite me. </p><p>Soapmaking cannot help but appeal to one's sense of frugality -- one can make a year's supply of fine quality bars for pennies each -- but beyond the economics, this is a folk art that makes ecological sense. Handmade soap contains nothing you do not add yourself, and the multiple additives that now find their way into both bathing and laundry soaps can happily be avoided. </p><p>My own interest in pure homemade soaps eventually led to the formation of a small country soap-making business, which in turn led me deeper into the history and lore of soap and which, finally, helped spawn this book ... </p><p>It is my hope that this book will move others to take up the art that has been largely lost, and in the process discover the unique pleasures of handmade soap. </p><p>Merilyn Mohr</p></p><h2>Red Orc&#39;s Rage</h2><p>While undergoing &#34;Tiersian&#34; therapy, Jim physically goes to the World of Tiers, experiencing exciting and disturbing adventures and occupying the fantastic mind of the Red Orc</p><p></p><h2>Sante D&#39;Orazio A Private View: Photographs and Diary</h2><p>An album of more than six hundred color and black-and-white photographs records the life and career of one of the world&#39;s preeminent fashion and celebrity photographers, in images from magazines, travel souvenirs, and personal notes. 35,000 first printing.</p><p></p><h2>Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art (Revised Edition)</h2><p><p>Painter Jean-Michel Basquiat was the Jimi Hendrix of the art world: in less than a decade he went from being a teenage graffiti writer to an international art star; he was dead of a drug overdose at age twenty-seven. Phoebe Hoban's <b>Basquiat</b>, the first biography of this charismatic figure, charts the trajectory from the artist's troubled childhood to his volatile passage through the white art world of dealers and nouveau-riche collectors, chronicling the meteoric success and overnight burnout that made him an instant art-world myth.</p> <p>As much the portrait of an era as the portrait of an artist, <b>Basquiat</b> is an incisive expose of the eighties art market that paints a vivid picture of the rise and fall of the graffiti movement, the East Village art scene, and the out-of-control auction houses. Ten years after the artist's death, <b>Basquiat</b> resurrects both the painter and his time.</p></p><p>This minutely reported book is as much a portrait of the frenzied, prodigal New York art world of the 1980s as it is a biography of Jean-Michel Basquiat, who died of a drug overdose at age 27 in 1988. Basquiat, one of very few African American artists to acquire an international reputation, left a thick web of dealers, collectors, friends, lovers, paintings, drawings, and used syringes behind him. Author Phoebe Hoban seems to have unblinkingly interviewed or examined them all. While she duly registers Basquiat's sad childhood, with his unstable Puerto Rican mother and punishing Haitian father, she doesn't make much of the deeper veins of sorrow and self-destruction that may have motivated the artist and informed his art. Rather, she allows his celebrity, which whisked him from street urchin to art star, to be the central trajectory of this story. The Warhol prot�g� would probably approve, as he was the primary obliterator of his own psychological depths, throwing away his short, phenomenally productive life in the edgy club and drug scene of downtown Manhattan. The miracle is that Basquiat was so good, and so serious, an artist, surrounded as he was by hype and cash. Hoban's book is a fluid, intricate, authoritative dissection of a time, a place, and--almost--a person. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i><b>Phoebe Hoban</b> has written about culture and the arts for <b>Vogue, Vanity Fair, GQ, Harper's Bazaar</b>, and the <b>New York Times</b>.

She wants to be the president when she grows up. Or a ballerina. Or the president and a ballerina. She&#39;s dramatic. She sings on the bus, screams like a baby after putting chile powder on her fresh mango and convinces her mom to buy five pair of new shoes for a big family.

This is the page-turning story of the early years of Manhattan under Dutch rule, with at its heart a battle between men who would be its leader, the autocratic despot Stuyvesant, and the liberal-minded lawyer Van den Donck. It is Russell Shorto&#39;s thesis that the overlooked history of the original Dutch colony, and the attitudes of the Dutch settlers, were the principal inspiration for the free-trade, multi-cultural, upwardly-mobile &#39;melting pot&#39; spirit of New York, and hence America.</p><p><p><b>In a landmark work of history, Russell Shorto presents astonishing information on the founding of our nation and reveals in riveting detail the crucial role of the Dutch in making America what it is today.<br></b><br>In the late 1960s, an archivist in the New York State Library made an astounding discovery: 12,000 pages of centuries-old correspondence, court cases, legal contracts, and reports from a forgotten society: the Dutch colony centered on Manhattan, which predated the thirteen original American colonies. For the past thirty years scholar Charles Gehring has been translating this trove, which was recently declared a national treasure. Now, Russell Shorto has made use of this vital material to construct a sweeping narrative of Manhattan's founding that gives a startling, fresh perspective on how America began. <br><br>In an account that blends a novelist's grasp of storytelling with cutting-edge scholarship, <br><i>The Island at the Center of the World</i> strips Manhattan of its asphalt, bringing us back to a wilderness island a hunting ground for Indians, populated by wolves and bears that became a prize in the global power struggle between the English and the Dutch. Indeed, Russell Shorto shows that Americas founding was not the work of English settlers alone but a result of the clashing of these two seventeenth century powers. In fact, it was Amsterdam Europe's most liberal city, with an unusual policy of tolerance and a polyglot society dedicated to free trade that became the model for the city of New Amsterdam on Manhattan. While the Puritans of New England were founding a society based on intolerance, on Manhattan the Dutch created a free-trade, upwardly-mobile melting pot that would help shape not only New York, but America.<br><br>The story moves from the halls of power in London and The Hague to bloody naval encounters on the high seas. The characters in the saga the men and women who played a part in Manhattan's founding range from the philosopher Rene Descartes to James, the Duke of York, to prostitutes and smugglers. At the heart of the story is a bitter power struggle between two men: Peter Stuyvesant, the autocratic director of the Dutch colony, and a forgotten American hero named Adriaen van der Donck, a maverick, liberal-minded lawyer whose brilliant political gamesmanship, commitment to individual freedom, and exuberant love of his new country would have a lasting impact on the history of this nation.</p><p>Praise for <i>The Island at the Center of the World</i><br>&#x201c;Russell Shorto&#x2019;s dramatic adventure tale about the settling of Manhattan will transform the way we look at American history. The Dutch colony, founded just three years after the Puritans landed in Massachusetts, quickly became the gateway for Germans, Italians, Jews, Scandinavians, Africans, and others who created the pluralistic mix that would define a new nation. Shorto&#x2019;s book recounts the fascinating struggle between Peter Stuyvesant and the lesser-known but more influential Adriaen van der Donck, whose appreciation for individual tolerance laid the foundation for our Bill of Rights and helped to create our national character. It&#x2019;s also the story of the remarkable age of exploration led by Henry Hudson and others who spread the culture of the European Renaissance to a distant wilderness. Based on a wealth of documents that archivist began translating forty years ago, Shorto has produced both a triumph of scholarship and a rollicking narrative. The result is an exciting drama about the roots of America&#x2019;s freedoms.&#x201d; &#x2014;Walter Isaacson, author of <i>Benjamin Franklin: An American Life</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Island at the Center of the World </i>ranks among the best books ever written about New Amsterdam, the Dutch settlement on Manhattan that would become New York City. Shorto&#x2019;s prose is deliciously rich and witty, and the story he tells&#x2014;drawing heavily on sources that have only recently come to light&#x2014;brings one surprise after another. His rediscovery of Adriaen van der Donck, Peter Stuyvesant&#x2019;s nemesis, is fascinating.&#x201d; &#x2014;Edwin G.

G.) Wells literary works are notable for being some of the first titles of the science fiction genre, and include such famed titles as The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds, The Island of Doctor Moreau, and The Invisible Man. Despite being fixedly associated with science fiction, Wells wrote extensively in other genres and on many subjects, including history, society and politics, and was heavily influenced by Darwinism. His first book, Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought, offered predictions about what technology and society would look like in the year 2000, many of which have proven accurate. Wells went on to pen over fifty novels, numerous non-fiction books, and dozens of short stories. His legacy has had an overwhelming influence on science fiction, popular culture, and even on technological and scientific innovation.

Three secret service agents. And millions for the taking. Charlie and Oliver Caruso are brothers who work at Greene and Greene, a private bank so exclusive there&#39;s a $2 million minimum to be a client. But when the door of success slams in their faces, the brothers are presented with an offer they can&#39;t refuse: $3 million in an abandoned account that can&#39;t be traced. It&#39;s the perfect victimless crime. Charlie and Oliver opt to take the money, but get much more than they bargained for. Now, with a lot of extra zeroes in their pockets and a friend found dead, the Secret Service and a female private investigator are closing in. Whose money did they take? How will they stay alive? And why is the Secret Service trying to kill them? Both Charlie and Oliver quickly realize it&#39;s not easy being The Millionaires.</p><p>What would you steal if you couldn't get caught? That's the tag line of Brad Meltzer's new thriller, which pits an ambitious young money manager against a corporate villain, whose intricate financial shenanigans accidentally put a huge chunk of dough right in front of a man who desperately needs it. Of course Oliver Caruso's conscience troubles him, but that doesn't keep him from letting his somewhat looser and less ethical brother convince him this is too good an opportunity to pass up. Meltzer's in interesting territory here, but in order to buy his premise, you have to believe that it's OK to steal if you have a good enough reason. This makes his protagonist, who narrates the novel, hard to root for and less than sympathetic. Despite this hollow ring, the book is nicely plotted and should please the author's enthusiastic fan club. <i>--Jane Adams</i>BRAD MELTZER is the author of the New York Times bestsellers The Tenth Justice, Dead Even, and The First Counsel.

Reprint.</p><p>Jennifer Roberson is the author of the <i>Sword-Dancer Saga</i> and the <i>Chronicles of the Cheysuli</i>, and collaborated with Melanie Rawn and Kate Elliott on the historical fantasy <i>The Golden Key</i>, a finalist for the World Fantasy Award. She has also published three historical novels, and several in other genres. An exhibitor and breeder of Cardigan Welsh Corgis, she lives on acreage in Northern Arizona with eight dogs and two cats. She is currently working on the third <i>Karavans</i> novel, with prologue available at her website, http://www.cheysuli.com/author/Index.html.In her surprise-filled sixth novel featuring the sword-dancers Tiger and Del (Sword-Dancer, etc.), Roberson packs enough into the finale to more than make up for a tediously talky first half, which is short on both sword and sorcery. Established fans may enjoy the banal and idle chatter between Southron-born Tiger and his beloved "bascha," the ironic term of endearment he constantly uses for the glamorous Northerner Del, but others may wish for more action. On the isle of Skandi, where the pair has taken sanctuary, things do eventually pick up. The two fight a few human enemies, some skilled in magic, as well as the fierce and poison-clawed Sandtiger, which gave Tiger his name and threatens Del. Most exciting is the epic battle between Tiger and the man who has pursued him for years, Abbu Bensir, also a top-flight sword-dancer. But none of this prepares the reader for the warm personal revelations that follow, making this such a satisfyingly human series. In an author's note at the end, Roberson charmingly explains why she chose to use first-person point of view, and a male POV at that, when third-person is the norm for fantasy novels ("Tiger was very insistent on telling his own story"). In addition, she stresses the primacy of storytelling over feminist message, though she's "particularly proud of the male readers who've written to say that the books have altered their views of women." Sensitive readers of both sexes should appreciate how Roberson rises above the usual genre cliches.

In her trademark easy-to-understand style, mathematician Karen French shows how sacred geometry permeates every level of being, manifesting itself in simple shapes and numbers, music and sounds, light and color, even in the mysteries of creation itself. But these geometrical archetypes are more than the building blocks of reality: they are gateways to profound new levels of awareness.</p><p>Throughout history we humans have searched for meaning to our existence. In The Hidden Geometry of Life Karen French reveals how geometry, in the broadest sense of the term, can provide the key to finding order, structure and significance within the astonishing multiplicity of the cosmos. <br>'Shaping Reality' focuses on the meaning of simple shapes. ...Together these forms make a Matrix - a model by which we can understand our place in time and space.<br>'Structure of Being' explores how all entities, including ourselves, come into existence. ...<br>'Medium of Sound' describes the fundamental importance of sound in facilitating the creation of reality. ...<br>'Let There Be Light' shows how light is an essential dynamic in our perception of reality. ...<br>'Gateway to Becoming' explores the holographic Universe, the power of directed thought and the profound truths inherent in mandalas and yantras. ...<br><br>Breathtaking in its scope and fascinating in its detail, this important book is nothing less than a comprehensive and coherent account in words and images, of the nature and meaning of the Universe - a vision in which science, art and spirit unite in an exhilarating celebration of wonder.Welcome to an incredible journey - into the heart of space, time, light and matter.

He addresses his early years&#x2014;shadowy times in postwar Paris that haunt his memory and have inspired his world-cherished body of fiction. In the spare, absorbing, and sometimes dreamlike prose that translator Mark Polizzotti captures unerringly, Modiano offers a memoir of his first twenty-one years. Termed one of his &#x201c;finest books&#x201d; by the <i>Guardian</i>, <i>Pedigree</i> is both a personal exploration and a luminous portrait of a world gone by. &nbsp;<br><br><i>Pedigree</i> sheds light on the childhood and adolescence that Modiano explores in <i>Suspended Sentences</i><i>,</i><i>Dora Bruder</i><i>,</i> and other novels. In this work he re-creates the louche, unstable, colorful world of his parents under the German Occupation; his childhood in a household of circus performers and gangsters; and his formative friendship with the writer Raymond Queneau. While acknowledging that memory is never assured, Modiano recalls with painful clarity the most haunting moments of his early life, such as the death of his ten-year-old brother. <i>Pedigree</i>, Modiano&#x2019;s only memoir, is a gift to his readers and a master key to the themes that have inspired his writing life.</p><p>A conversation with translator Mark Polizzotti <br> <br> <i>Pedigree</i>&nbsp;is a late work for Patrick Modiano that deals with his youth.&nbsp; What do we learn about him?&nbsp; <br> <br> Several things that I believe are essential to understanding Modiano&#x2019;s fictions. First, just how closely certain key recurring episodes in his novels are patterned on real events from his early life, and how profoundly they have shaped his sensibility. But also we learn about the context in which he grew up. For instance, certain areas of Paris&#x2014;the Bois de Boulogne, or particular streets in the 6th or 16th arrondissement&#x2014;show up frequently in his works; this memoir gives the backstory. More significantly, Modiano alludes in various novels to his problematic relations with his absentee mother and distant but controlling father; only after reading&nbsp; <i>Pedigree</i>&nbsp;did I truly grasp that complicated and heartbreaking dynamic. <br> &nbsp; <br> Winning the Nobel Prize in 2014 certainly changed the fortune of Modiano&#x2019;s literary career. How do you see his work in the tradition of Nobel laureates? <br> <br> One of the things that most appeals to me about Modiano&#x2019;s writing is its apparent modesty&#x2014;or rather, its ability to treat some of the great issues of the twentieth century, such as human responsibility in times of crisis or the vicissitudes of identity, without grandstanding or self-conscious profundity. Unlike many Nobel winners, his work does not proclaim its importance, but instead remains on a personal, human scale; the more universal significance of his writings is read, as it were, between the lines. This deceptively simple, &#x201c;local&#x201d; quality makes his work, to my mind, much more accessible and enjoyable to read than the works of many recent laureates&#x2014;but no less deserving of the honor.<b>Patrick Modiano</b>, winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize for literature and an internationally beloved novelist, lives in Paris, France. <b>Mark Polizzotti </b>has translated more than forty books from the French and is director of the publications program at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.</p><h2>Isis Magic Cultivating a Relationship with the Goddess of 10,000 Names</h2><p><b><i>Isis Magic</i> is back, in a new 10th Anniversary Edition, revised &amp; expanded with new rituals and meditations</b> <p> </p><p>The House of Isis is open to you.

They say that God became Man. Every other miracle prepares the way for this, or results from this.&#39; This is the key statement of Miracles, in which C. S. Lewis shows that a Christian must not only accept but rejoice in miracles as a testimony of the unique personal involvement of God in his creation. Using his characteristic lucidity and wit to develop his argument, Lewis challenges the rationalists and cynics who are mired in their lack of imagination and provides a poetic and joyous affirmation that miracles really fo occur in our everyday lives.</p><p><p><em>Do miracles really happen?

Lewis takes this key idea and shows that a Christian must not only accept but rejoice in miracles as a testimony of the unique personal involvement of God in creation.

He was a Fellow and Tutor in English literature at Oxford University until 1954 when he was unanimously elected to the Chair of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge University, a position he held until his retirement. His major contributions in literary criticism, children&#39;s literature, fantasy literature and popular theology brought him international renown and acclaim.

The story of her unhappy marriage to a fanatical army officer is told against the background of the appalling confusion and corruption of China at that time: the Japanese invasion, the misery and squalor of the retreating Chinese, the activities of Chiang Kaishek and his &#39;Blueshirts&#39;, the violent prelude to revolution. Ill-treated and misunderstood, Han Suyin goes to work as a midwife in Chengtu, and it is there her career as a writer begins. Later, unable to have a child herself, she adopts a daughter. When her husband becomes military attache in London, Han Suyin follows him there and she describes in fascinating detail her life as a diplomat&#39;s wife in wartime. In 1944, she enrolls as a medical student and, after qualifying, she spends a year as house surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital. As the Chinese civil war turns into revolution, Han Suyin, now a widow, returns to Hong-Kong. Han Suyin&#39;s narrative is not merely the affecting and extraordinary life story of a woman of immense courage. In the way that if brings to life more powerfully than ever before the spirit and politics of China, it is a significant contribution to the history of our time.</p><p></p><h2>Betrock&#39;s Cultivated Palms of the World</h2><p>The most comprehensive photographic reference ever published for palms in cultivation.

McKillip is a winner of the World Fantasy Award, and the author of many fantasy novels, including <b>The Riddlemaster of Hed</b> trilogy, <b>Stepping from the Shadows</b>, and <b>The Cygnet and the Firebird</b>. She lives in Oregon.Once the city of Berylon was benevolently ruled by Raven Tormalyne, until his rival, the ambitious Arioso Pellior, the Basilisk, burned Tormalyne Palace. Of all the family, only young Rook, cowering under the ashes in the fireplace, survived. Rook was sent to the remote island Luly, where he became a bard (poet/musician) and produced a son, Hollis, but could never bring himself to remember his heritage. Nearly 40 years later, young Griffin Tormalyne, a distant relative, arrives at Luly, forcing Rook to confront his past. So he travels into the magical hinterlands, where, after various adventures, he recovers his memory and some of his inherited magic powers. But when he returns to Luly, Griffin is dead and the school burned. The Basilisk, meantime, a master of subtle magics, trains his dragon-eyed daughter Luna to succeed him. Rook, arriving in Berylon, takes a job cataloguing old music manuscripts that the Basilisk recovered from ruined Tormalyne Palace, and acquires a magical pipe to use against the Basilisk. But there are further complications: relatives of Griffin are smuggling in weapons and plotting against the Basilisk; the Basilisk's plain, empty-headed daughter Damiet falls in love with Rook; Hollis shows up; and Rook finds himself strongly attracted to Luna, a magician more powerful than her father. Previous McKillip offerings (Winter Rose, 1996, etc.) have been charming, elegant wisps; this one, after a rather laborious start, presses forward with altogether more determination and substance: a significant improvement overall. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

For reasons he describes in his Author's Note, Milan Kundera devoted much time to creating (with the assistance of his American publisher-editor) a completely revised translation that reflects his original as closely as any translation possibly can: reflects it in its fidelity not only to the words and syntax but also to the characteristic dictions and tonalities of the novel's narrators.

A former film director in New York and Hollywood, his films have won awards at festivals around the world. He has taught film at New York&#39;s School of Visual Arts and at Eastern Washington University.Spokane-based critic and teacher Glatzer targets uninitiated but curious moviegoers who want to assess films intelligently and place them in context. He discusses film acting and camera placement; the jobs of cinematographer, editor, art director, composer, casting director, grip, and assistant director; foreign films; and truly great directors (a debatable selection, naturally). In addition, there are thumbnail sketches of 143 must-see movies, and the ubiquitous director "Alan Smithee" is defined. Glatzer is best when analyzing Buster Keaton's comedy and identifying stories unworthy of their supposed significance. And his "Ten Minute Movie Maven" epilog could stand on its own as a magazine article. On the negative side, seasoned moviegoers will take issue with Glatzer's views that the only leading ladies who aren't "drop-dead gorgeous" are Renee Zellweger and Minnie Driver, that Arnold Schwarzenegger never played a heroic role until Terminator 2 (ignoring Conan, Predator, Total Recall, and Kindergarten Cop), and that director Robert Wise (The Set-Up, The Day the Earth Stood Still, I Want To Live!, West Side Story) is a "hack."

It&#x2019;s a twenty-first-century myth, starring a queer woman as the hero of the human race, and is a translation of the last ten years of my life. </p> <p>The path to this novel was very roundabout. I was born the youngest of five children in a tiny college town where my Dad taught religion. Writing always came naturally to me, which meant that I (as a rebellious teenager) distrusted it as a vocation. Instead I decided I wanted to do something hard: to be the first human on Mars. </p> <p>Over the next ten years I majored in biochemistry, got my pilot&#x2019;s license, worked for NASA, attended astrobiology academy, and went to MIT for a doctorate in geochemistry, which, I figured, would equip me perfectly to analyze Martian soil samples for signs of life once I was camped out on Olympus Mons. </p> <p>But I had a profound conversion experience in graduate school. I realized that much of why I wanted to be an astronaut was a fatalistic impulse, borne of the sadness of losing my mother at a young age. At the same time, I was falling back in love with art, writing, theater, and improv&#x2014;all the things that gave me pleasure, but that I&#x2019;d never allowed myself to pursue. I left graduate school and restructured my life to become an artist. Soon after, I won a fellowship to travel to Ethiopia and India&#x2014;a trip that changed my life so thoroughly it took me years to process why. The result was <i>The Girl in the Road</i>. </p> <p>It is set in the near future, and India is the economic and cultural heart of the world. Meena, a young woman fleeing from a traumatic event, decides to walk the Trail, a floating pontoon bridge that spans the entire Arabian Sea&#x2014;all the way to the east coast of Africa, where her parents were murdered in the aftermath of a contentious election in Ethiopia. As told concurrently, forty years earlier, an enslaved girl named Mariama flees her home in Mauritania. She finds refuge in a caravan headed across the Sahara, and grows up in Ethiopia, where a youth uprising is taking root. </p> <p>Conventional wisdom holds that first novels are autobiographical. That&#x2019;s certainly true for me, even though <i>The Girl in the Road</i> takes place sixty years in the future, on the other side of the planet, starring characters who look very different from me. Then again, this is part of the point: we are entering a time of history when humankind must learn to act with a global consciousness. This book is, I hope, an expression of that new consciousness. </p><p><b>MONICA BYRNE</b> studied at Wellesley College and MIT.

Summary; With Death in Holy Orders, P. D. James makes a triumphant return to the genre for which she is best known - the classic English detective story. The story is set in an Anglican theological college on a desolate stretch of the East Anglian coast. When the body of one of the students is found on the shore, his wealthy father demands that Scotland Yard should reexamine the verdict of accidental death. Dalgliesh has visited St Anselm's in his boyhood and, as he is due for a holiday, agrees to pay a visit. As the weekend brings another murder, Dalgliesh soon finds himself embroiled in one of the most horrific and puzzling cases of his career...Death in Holy Orders is vintage P. D. James with sensitive evocation of place, a complex and credible mystery, respect for forensic detail and the tension a plot that never flags. Review: "'P.D. James is one of the national treasures of British fiction...Each new book gives pleasure.' Malcolm Bradbury, Mail on Sunday".Subjects; Police - Fiction.

Dalgliesh, Adam (Fictitious character) ; Fiction ; Police. Genres; Detective and mystery stories. Fiction.</p><p>Despite challenges from Ruth Rendell and (more recently) Minette Walters, P.D. James's position as Britain's Queen of Crime remains largely unassailable. Although a certain reaction has set in to her reputation (and there are those who claim her poetry-loving copper Adam Dalgliesh doesn't correspond to any of his counterparts in the real world), her detractors can scarcely deny her astonishing literary gifts. More than any other writer, she has elevated the detective story into the realms of literature, with the psychology of the characters treated in the most complex and authoritative fashion. Her plots, too, are full of intriguing detail and studed with brilliantly observed character studies. Who cares if Dalgliesh belongs more in the pages of a book than poking around a graffiti-scrawled council estate? As a policeman, he is considerably more plausible than Doyle's Holmes, and that's never stopped us loving the Baker Street sleuth. <i>Death in Holy Orders</i> represents something of a challenge from James to her critics, taking on all the contentious elements and rigorously reinvigorating them. She had admitted that she was finding it increasingly difficult to find new plots for Dalgliesh, and the locale here (a theological college on a lonely stretch of the East Anglian coast) turns out to be an inspired choice. We're presented with the enclosed setting so beloved of golden age detective writers, and James is able to incorporate her theological interests seamlessly into the plot (but never in any doctrinaire way; the nonbeliever is never uncomfortable). The body of a student at the college is found on the shore, suffocated by a fall of sand. Dalgliesh is called upon to reexamine the verdict of accidental death (which the student's father would not accept). Having visited the College of St. Anselm in his boyhood, he finds the investigation has a strong nostalgic aspect for him. But that is soon overtaken by the realization that he has encountered the most horrific case of his career, and another visitor to the college dies a horrible death. As an exploration of evil--and as a piece of highly distinctive crime writing--this is James at her nonpareil best. Dalgliesh, too, is rendered with new dimensions of psychological complexity. <i>--Barry Forshaw, Amazon.co.uk</i>"There are very few thriller writers who can compete with P. D. James at her best ... One of the things that sets P. D. James apart from other writers in this genre is the intellectual assurance of her work. This is manifest in her use of language - she writes beautifully - but also in the light touch with which she displays her learning ... DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS is pure pleasure." --Charlotte Joll, <i>The Spectator</i><br>"DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS is a page-turner ... but it is also so well-written that you linger over James's beautifully-observed descriptions of characters or scenes ... More, please, P. D. James." --Rosita Boland, <i>The Irish Times</i><br>"James transcends the crime genre, in that hers are fully evolved novels and not just murder mysteries. They are packed with argument and insight and detail." --Victoria Glendinning, <i>The Daily Telegraph</i><br>"This is a thoroughly satisfactory, gripping and exceptionally well-written novel." --Anne Chisholm, <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i><br>"James is a natural storyteller when it comes to pace and atmosphere." --Sarah Dunant, <i>The Times</i><br>"Adam Dalgliesh's latest outing possesses the confident interplay of classical discipline, contemporary morality and strong evocation of place that had hitherto distinguished James's novels. Writing for the most part within the conventions of the detective story, she has again proved its constraints to be a liberating force for the creative imagination, drawing on accepted generic elements to produce a thoughtful, beautifully-written book which is far more complex than the sum of its parts." --Nicola Upson, <i>The Observer</i><br>"This is a grand, gothic novel of gut-wrenching suspense, satisfying at all levels. (...) Here is a novel which goes beyond mere enjoyment." --Frances Fyfield, <i>The Sunday Express</i></p><h2>Descent Into Darkness: Pearl Harbor, 1941: A Navy Diver&#39;s Memoir</h2><p>A tribute to the audacious Navy divers who performed the almost super-human deeds that served to shorten the war.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;Within hours of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Raymer, an enlisted man, was on a plane headed from San Diego to Oahu. His primary mission: to act as chief diver in the operations to rescue men trapped in sunken battleships. Removing bodies, recovering material and raising the ships themselves could, and would, come later. In this compelling memoir, Raymer describes the multiple hazards of working inside wreckage-strewn warships under the handicaps imposed by available diving technology. Courage was at least as important as competence as the number of dives mounted and the law of averages shifted against the men who went down. Raymer details many harrowing incidents, including one in which he, an arachnophobe, began to panic when a spider stowed away in his diving suit began to crawl over his face in the middle of a dive. The narrative includes lighter passages as well, especially the depictions of how the divers spent their off-duty hours pursuing food, liquor and women. For all its drama and charm, however, Raymer's memoir is useful above all as a case study of the hands-on, un-bureaucratized approach to problem-solving that the U.S. brought to WWII from the beginning.

And when Rowland offends right-wing New Guard leader Eric Campbell, Campbell uses his influence to set the police to renew their inquiries into Henry Sinclair's death.</b></p><p>Henry's friends had all been led to believe that the wealthy landowner had died in a much more respectable way. Rowland and his elder brother, Wil, had avoided any discussion of the event ever since-in fact the whole family had ducked the issue for over a decade, keeping secret that Sinclair senior was murdered. The possible involvement of the teenage Rowly and his older brother's intervention has been under the radar as well.</p><p>But now the finger of blame is pointing squarely at the Sinclair black sheep, a man careless of what society and the authorities think of him. So he and the trio of artist friends who live in his Sydney suburban mansion, and generally have his back, avail themselves of a racing green Gypsy Moth (Rowland is a pioneer in air travel) and a yellow Mercedes sports car (another frightening mode of transport) to arrive in New South Wales' Southern Tablelands, bent on clearing Rowly's name.</p><p>With cameo appearances from historical figures-Bob Menzies in the Sinclair kitchen, Edna Walling in the garden, and Kate Leigh grinning lasciviously at Rowly in a jailhouse crowd-and a real sense of fun contrasting with the quite genuine tension, this is historical crime for those in the know and those who can barely remember what happened last weekend, a story of family secrets and fraternal loyalty.

Chesterton</h2><p>Through years of meticulous research and access to the literary estate of G.K. Chesterton, Joseph Pearce presents a major biography of a 20th century literary giant, providing a great deal of important information on GKC never before published. This is a thoroughly readable and delightful biography of a multi-faceted author, artist and debater who loved the friendship of children, idolized his wife and enjoyed great friendships with the likes of Hillaire Belloc, Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells. Illustrated.</p><p><p><strong>Joseph Pearce</strong> is the author of numerous literary works including&nbsp;<em>Literary Converts</em>, <em>The Quest for Shakespeare</em> and <em>Shakespeare on Love</em>, and the editor of the Ignatius Critical Editions series. His other books include literary biographies of Oscar Wilde, J.R.R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, G. K. Chesterton and Alexander Solzhenitsyn.</p>In this spiritual biography of the English social commentator and author, most memorably, of the Father Brown mysteries, English author Pearce focuses primarily on Chesterton's conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1922. Pearce goes on to celebrate Chesterton's happy childhood and family life, successful marriage, and friendships with Hilaire Belloc, George Bernard Shaw, and other Victorian and 20th-century writers. Also detailed are Chesterton's social and political activism as well as his romanticism and childlike joie de vivre. Pearce draws copiously from Chesterton's published writings and correspondence and from previous biographies, notably those by Maisie Ward, Michael Coren, and Michael Ffinch. Indeed, 26 pages of endnotes demonstrate the heavy reliance of the author on these sources. The result is a marginal offering that may be considered for religion collections and for those specializing in minor English authors of the early 20th century.?Nancy M.

That peace cannot be found in the pounding polarity waves of hope-disappointment or joy-sadness. That while we may not be able to change what we see, we can choose how we see it. That real freedom, the most feared option of all, is always present, ours for the taking when we are done with searching everywhere else and decide to operate as our own sacred selves. To the worldly mind, seeing ourselves as gods-in-embryo is heresy, a lie.

This is the advice of the Harts, two experts in animal communication and behavior, whose new book takes the process of selecting a cat to the next level by offering data-based behavioral profiles of a wide range of cat breeds. Developed over a lifetime of research and through extensive interviews with eighty veterinary experts, the profiles are presented in easy-to-use graphical form. A history of the development of different breeds is presented, and then breed-specific differences across a range of variables are discussed. These include twelve behavioral traits, in areas such as affection, sociality, activity level, and litter box use. After giving guidance about choosing a cat, the authors present some strategies for avoiding problem behaviors and resolving those that emerge. They also share fascinating theories about the origins of various common cat behaviors, including purring, yawning, eating grass, flipping out on catnip, and staking out territory. While the focus is on purebred cats, there is also lots of good information for owners of blends. The book ends with helpful guidance on further reading. Based on the latest science, this is a great book for anyone interested in the fundamental building blocks of feline behavior, and an invaluable handbook for cat owners.</p><p>Benjamin L. Hart, Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, has always taken a passionate interest in animal behavior, which has had an immense effect on his life&#39;s work. At UC Davis he developed the first comprehensive teaching program in companion animal behavior and was chief of the Behavior Service in the veterinary hospital. He is the author of almost two hundred publications, many of which focus on resolving behavior problems in cats.Lynette A. Hart studied animal communication during her doctoral education at Rutgers University. She was founding director of the Center for Animals in Society at the University of California, and among her approximately one hundred publications are landmark studies on the socializing effects of animals for people with disabilities, and the grieving process associated with the death of a beloved companion animal.

They found more than a million tribespeople who never had experienced contact with the outside world. One of the prospectors, Michael Leahy, recorded the confrontation between 20th century and Stone Age cultures in photographs and film footage. This documentary evidence was forgotten for 50 years, until filmmakers Connolly and Anderson stumbled across it. Fascinated, they tracked down both the surviving prospectors and tribespeople for a series of interviews that produced an extraordinary portrait of the two sides of "first contact." Village elders tell how they reacted when white men and their weapons appeared: "We thought the gun was just for shooting pigs and that it couldn't hurt men." The Leahy brothers saw the contact from a different perspective; they never attempted to learn about native culture or to regard the people other than as objects to be exploited. The opposing viewpoints presented here interact to create a classic story of colonialism and its aftereffects. Photos. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.In 1930 when the Leahy brothers of Australia led a gold-prospecting expedition into the highlands of Papua New Guinea they came into contact with a primitive civilization that had never before met people from the outside world. A cache of films and photographs taken by the brothers was uncovered in 1980 by the authors, who produced a highly acclaimed film titled First Contact in 1983. Further investigation, including interviews with survivors and archival research, resulted in this fascinating, well-written, and well-documented account of the episode and the consequences of the encounter. The numerous photographs capturing the expressions of the natives are truly rewarding. Recommended for interested laypersons as well as scholars and specialists.

The College of War calculated that the regular army amounted to 541,741 men, plus 46,601 enrolled cossacks, and at least a further 100,000 irregular cavalry which could be mobilised in time of war.

When he is good, he is very good; at other times he can be underpowering. Some of these tales are highly interesting, imbued with power and the ability to startle; in others, McGuane seems to be coasting, failing to deliver the bite that makes the difference between a good and a great story. The title narrative, the last in the collection, has that bite. The tale of a jaded young man who aspires to become a pimp, it teeters on the edge of the bizarre until it finally crosses over. Another story, "The Millionaire," exhibits a delicious tension as the parents of a pregnant teenager await the arrival of the child whose adoption has already been arranged as a sort of birth of convenience. Taken as a whole, the collection is entertaining, sometimes memorable. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this short story collection, McGuane focuses his Midwest perspective on the eccentricities of small towns and their inhabitants. A pregnant girl selling her baby, a man who steals his neighbor's dogs, a young boy imprisoned by bullies, and topics such as infidelity, hunting, and handicaps all are explored. McGuane is distanced from his characters, and the writing is self-conscious at worst, interesting at best. Though he seems to have something to say, his laconic style often muddles the meaning. The title story is quite different in tempo from the othersto the point of being anomalousand appears to parody something, but again the intention isn't clear. Buy for demand, though even his fans may be disappointed.

Irene Spencer spent 28 years in a polygamous marriage to a man who, from day one, was so insensitive, dishonest, and full of himself that the listener's question is why would anyone sane put up with him, let alone with the shocking poverty and danger he provided, when she had other choices? Spencer tells what happened--the thirteen children, the eight sister-wives, the insane brother-in-law's murder spree, and her endless disappointments and angers--and it's an astonishing human document. But she cannot in the end explain why she stayed, only that she did. Spencer offers the word "brainwashing." Accurate, without doubt, but it leaves one questioning.

For me, fear was a given I factored into the events of the day, like a pebble that never leaves your shoe. In retrospect, an adult might call that a form of courage. If so, it wasn&#x2019;t much fun.<br> <br>My tale begins on a Saturday at the close of spring term of my junior year in 1952, when my father let me use his car to join my high school buds on Galveston Beach, fifty miles south of Houston. Actually, the car was not his; it was lent to him by his company for business use, with the understanding that only he would drive it. That he would lend it to me was an act of enormous trust. My friends and I had a fine day playing touch football on the sand, and as they built a bonfire toward evening, I decided to swim out to the third sandbar south of the island, the last place your feet could still touch bottom. It was not only deep and cold, it was also hammerhead country. I had never done this by myself, and even when I once swam to the third sandbar with a group, most of us had been drunk.<br> <br>I waded through the breakers, then inhaled deeply and dove into the first swell and kept stroking through the waves, crossing the first sandbar and then the second, never resting, turning my face sideways to breathe, until I saw the last sandbar, waves undulating across its crest, gulls dipping into the froth.<br> <br>I stood erect, my back tingling with sunburn. The only sounds were the gulls and the water slapping against my loins. I could see a freighter towing a scow, then they both disappeared beyond the horizon. I dove headlong into a wave and saw the sandy bottom drop away into darkness. The water was suddenly frigid, the waves sliding over me as heavy as concrete. The hotels and palm trees and the amusement pier on the beach had become miniaturized. A triangular-shaped fin sliced through the swell and disappeared beneath a wave, a solitary string of bubbles curling behind it.<br> <br>Then I felt my heart seize, and not because of a shark. I was surrounded by jellyfish, big ones with bluish-pink air sacs and gossamer tentacles that could wrap around your neck or thighs like swarms of wet yellow jackets.<br> <br>My experience with the jellyfish seemed to characterize my life. No matter how sun-spangled the day might seem, I always felt a sense of danger. It wasn&#x2019;t imaginary, either. The guttural roar of Hollywood mufflers on a souped-up Ford coupe, a careless glance at the guys in ducktail haircuts and suede stomps and pegged pants called drapes, and in seconds you could be pounded into pulp. Ever watch a television portrayal of the fifties? What a laugh.<br> <br>A psychiatrist would probably say my fears were an externalization of my problems at home. Maybe he would be right, although I have always wondered how many psychiatrists have gone up against five or six guys who carried chains and switchblades and barber razors, and didn&#x2019;t care if they lived or died, and ate their pain like ice cream. Or maybe I saw the world through a glass darkly and the real problem was me. The point is, I was always scared. Just like swimming through the jellyfish. Contact with just one of them was like touching an electric cable. My fear was so great I was urinating inside my swim trunks, the warmth draining along my thighs. Even after I had escaped the jellyfish and rejoined my high school chums by a bonfire, sparks twisting into a turquoise sky, a bottle of cold Jax in my hand, I could not rid myself of the abiding sense of terror that rested like hot coals in the pit of my stomach.<br> <br>I never discussed my home life with my friends. My mother consulted fortune-tellers, listened in on the party line, and was always giving me enemas when I was a child. She locked doors and pulled down window shades and inveighed against alcohol and the effect it had on my father. Theatricality and depression and genuine sorrow seemed her constant companions. Sometimes I would see the cautionary look in the eyes of our neighbors when my parents were mentioned in a conversation, as though they needed to protect me from learning about my own home. In moments like these I&#x2019;d feel shame and guilt and anger and not know why. I&#x2019;d sit in my bedroom, wanting to hold something that was heavy and hard in my palm, I didn&#x2019;t know what. My uncle Cody was a business partner of Frankie Carbo of Murder, Inc. My uncle introduced me to Bugsy Siegel when he was staying at the Shamrock Hotel with Virginia Hill. Sometimes I would think about these gangsters and the confidence in their expression and the deadness in their eyes when they gazed at someone they didn&#x2019;t like, and I&#x2019;d wonder what it would be like if I could step inside their skin and possess their power.<br> <br>The day I swam through the jellyfish without being stung was the day that changed my life forever. I was about to enter a country that had no flag or boundaries, a place where you gave up your cares and your cautionary instincts and deposited your heart on a stone altar. I&#x2019;m talking about the first time you fall joyously, sick-down-in-your-soul in love, and the prospect of heartbreak never crosses your mind.<br> <br>Her name was Valerie Epstein. She was sitting in a long-bodied pink Cadillac convertible, what we used to call a boat, in a drive-in restaurant wrapped in neon, near the beach, her bare shoulders powdered with sunburn. Her hair wasn&#x2019;t just auburn; it was thick and freshly washed and had gold streaks in it, and she had tied it up on her head with a bandana, like one of the women who worked in defense plants during the war. She was eating french fries one at a time with her fingers and listening to a guy sitting behind the steering wheel like a tall drink of water. His hair was lightly oiled and sun-bleached, his skin pale and free of tattoos. He wore shades, even though the sun was molten and low in the sky, the day starting to cool. With his left hand he kept working a quarter across the tops of his fingers, like a Las Vegas gambler or a guy with secret skills. His name was Grady Harrelson. He was two years older than I and had already graduated, which meant I knew who he was but he didn&#x2019;t know who I was. Grady had wide, thin shoulders, like a basketball player, and wore a faded purple T-shirt that on him somehow looked stylish. He had been voted the most handsome boy in the school not once but twice. A guy like me had no trouble hating a guy like Grady.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know why I got out of my car. I was tired, and my back felt stiff and dry and peppered with salt and sand under my shirt, and I had to drive fifty miles back to Houston and return the car to my father before dark. The evening star was already winking inside a blue band of light on the horizon. I had seen Valerie Epstein twice from a distance but never up close. Maybe the fact that I&#x2019;d swum safely through a school of jellyfish was an omen. Valerie Epstein was a junior at Reagan High School, on the north side of Houston, and known for her smile and singing voice and straight A&#x2019;s. Even the greaseballs who carried chains under their car seats and stilettos in their drapes treated her as royalty.<br> <br>Get back in the car and finish your crab burger and go home, a voice said.<br> <br>For me, low self-esteem was not a step down but a step up. I was alone, yet I didn&#x2019;t want to go home. It was Saturday, and I knew that before dark my father would walk unsteadily back from the icehouse, the neighbors looking the other way while they watered their yards. I had friends, but most of them didn&#x2019;t know the real me, nor in reality did I know them. I lived in an envelope of time and space that I wanted to mail to another planet.<br> <br>I headed for the restroom, on a path between the passenger side of the convertible and a silver-painted metal stanchion with a speaker on it that was playing &#x201c;Red Sails in the Sunset.&#x201d; Then I realized Valerie Epstein was having an argument with Grady and on the brink of crying.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anything wrong?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Grady turned around, his neck stretching, his eyelids fluttering. &#x201c;Say again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought maybe something was wrong and y&#x2019;all needed help.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get lost, snarf.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a snarf?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you deaf?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just want to know what a snarf is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A guy who gets off on sniffing girls&#x2019; bicycle seats. Now beat it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The music speaker went silent. My ears were popping. I could see people&#x2019;s lips moving in the other cars, but I couldn&#x2019;t hear any sound. Then I said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel like it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I heard you right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a free country.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not for nosy frumps, it isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Leave him alone, Grady,&#x201d; Valerie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a frump?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;A guy who farts in the bathtub and bites the bubbles. Somebody put you up to this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was going to the restroom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then go.&#x201d;<br> <br>This time I didn&#x2019;t reply. Somebody, probably one of Grady&#x2019;s friends, flicked a hot cigarette at my back. Grady opened his car door so he could turn around and speak without getting a crick in his neck. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, pencil dick?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aaron Holland Broussard.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m about to walk you into the restroom and unscrew your head and stuff it in the commode, Aaron Holland Broussard. Then I&#x2019;m going to piss on it before I flush. What do you think of that?&#x201d;<br> <br>The popping sound in my ears started again. The parking lot and the canvas canopy above the cars seemed to tilt sideways; the red and yellow neon on the restaurant became a blur, like licorice melting, running down the windows.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing to say?&#x201d; Grady asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;A girl told me the only reason you won &#x2018;most handsome&#x2019; is that all the girls thought you were queer-bait and felt sorry for you. Some of the jocks told me the same thing. They said you used to chug pole under the seats at the football stadium.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know where the words came from. I felt like the wiring between my thoughts and my words had been severed. Cracking wise to an older guy just didn&#x2019;t happen at my high school, particularly if the older guy lived in River Oaks and his father owned six rice mills and an independent drilling company. But something even more horrible was occurring as I stood next to Grady&#x2019;s convertible. I was looking into the eyes of Valerie Epstein as though hypnotized. They were the most beautiful and mysterious eyes I had ever seen; they were deep-set, luminous, the color of violets. They were also doing something to me I didn&#x2019;t think possible: In the middle of the drive-in, my twanger had gone on autopilot. I put my hand in my pocket and tried to knock down the tent forming in my fly.<br> <br>&#x201c;You got a boner?&#x201d; Grady said, incredulous.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my car keys. They punched a hole in my pocket.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he said, his face contorting with laughter. &#x201c;Hey, everybody, dig this guy! He&#x2019;s flying the flag. Anyone got a camera? When&#x2019;s the last time you got your ashes hauled, Snarfus?&#x201d;<br> <br>My face was burning. I felt I was in one of those dreams in which you wet your pants at the front of the classroom. Then Valerie Epstein did something I would never be able to repay her for, short of opening my veins. She flung her carton of french fries, ketchup and all, into Grady&#x2019;s face. At first he was too stunned to believe what she had done; he began picking fries from his skin and shirt like bloody leeches and flicking them on the asphalt. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m letting this pass. You&#x2019;re not yourself. Settle down. You want me to apologize to this kid? Hey, buddy, I&#x2019;m sorry. Yeah, you, fuckface. Here, you want some fries? I&#x2019;ll stick a couple up your nose.&#x201d;<br> <br>She got out of the car and slammed the door. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re pathetic,&#x201d; she said, jerking a graduation ring and its chain from her neck, hurling it on the convertible seat. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call. Don&#x2019;t come by the house. Don&#x2019;t write. Don&#x2019;t send your friends to make excuses for you, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Val. We&#x2019;re a team,&#x201d; he said, wiping his face with a paper napkin. &#x201c;You want another Coke?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s over, Grady. You can&#x2019;t help what you are. You&#x2019;re selfish and dishonest and disrespectful and cruel. In my stupidity, I thought I could change you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll work this out. I promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>She wiped her eyes and didn&#x2019;t answer. Her face was calm now, even though her breath was still catching, as though she had hiccups.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do this to me, Val,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I love you. Get real. Are you going to let a dork like this break us up?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Goodbye, Grady.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How you going to get home?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to worry about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to leave you on the street. Now get in. You&#x2019;re starting to make me mad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What a tragedy for the planet that would be,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You know what my father said of you? &#x2018;Grady&#x2019;s not a bad kid. He&#x2019;s simply incapable of being a good one.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come back. Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you have a great life,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Even though the memory of kissing you makes me want to rinse my mouth with peroxide.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then she walked away, like Helen of Troy turning her back on Attica. A gust of warm wind blew newspapers along the boulevard into the sky. The light was orange and bleeding out of the clouds in the west, the horizon darkening, the waves crashing on the beach just the other side of Seawall Boulevard, the palm trees rattling dryly in the wind. I could smell the salt and the seaweed and the tiny shellfish that had dried on the beach, like the smell of birth. I watched Valerie walk through the cars to the boulevard, her beach bag swinging from her shoulder and bouncing on her butt. Grady was standing next to me, breathing hard, his gaze locked on Valerie, just as mine was, except there was an irrevocable sense of loss in his eyes that made me think of a groundswell, the kind you see rising from the depths when a storm is about to surge inland.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry this happened to y&#x2019;all,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re in public, so I can&#x2019;t do what I&#x2019;m thinking. But you&#x2019;d better find a rat hole and crawl in it,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Blaming others won&#x2019;t help your situation,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>He wiped a streak of ketchup off his cheek. &#x201c;I was hoping you&#x2019;d say something like that.&#x201d;</p><h2>Shakespeare&#39;s Tremor and Orwell&#39;s Cough: The Medical Lives of Famous Writers</h2><p><p><i>The doctor suddenly appeared beside Will, startling him. He was sleek and prosperous, with a dainty goatee. Though he smiled reassuringly, the poet noticed that he kept a safe distance. In a soothing, urbane voice, the physician explained the treatment: stewed prunes to evacuate the bowels; succulent meats to ease digestion; cinnabar and the sweating tub to cleanse the disease from the skin. The doctor warned of minor side effects: uncontrolled drooling, fetid breath, bloody gums, shakes and palsies.

The author takes us way back, when leeches were used for bleeding and cupping was a common method of cure, to a time before vaccinations, sterilized scalpels, or real drug regimens.

Master Shakespeare pulled the hood of his cloak down low over his eyes and hurried from his lodgings in Bishopsgate, walking as quickly as he could on his hobbled legs. He awkwardly dodged a pair of rambling pigs and picked his way through the dung and muck of the city streets. The stench and filth rarely troubled him now, as they had when he first came here from the country. Nearer the bridge, the clamor of the city increased: the clatter of carts, the cries of street peddlers, the gossip of alewives, the drunken braggadocio of London gallants. A black-clad Puritan surveyed the scene sourly and made brief eye contact with Will. The player hung his head and balled his hands into fists&#x2014;to hide the telltale rash on his palms.<br>London Bridge was marvelous and strange, a massive structure built over with splendid houses. With relief he entered the dark, claustrophobic tunnel beneath the dwellings. Inside, a continual roar of noise: the tidal rush of water between the ancient piers; waterwheels creaking; apprentices brawling; carters disputing the right-of-way; a blind fiddler playing; sheep bleating on their way to Eastcheap, bound for slaughter. He left the shelter of the bridge, and emerged into painful sunlight on the other side. His shins throbbed and his muscles ached. In spite of himself, he peered up at the great stone gate at the end of the bridge, adorned with traitors&#x2019; heads on pikes. Shreds of moldy flesh clung to the grinning skulls, their tattered hair bleached by sun and rain.<br>In Southwark, he heard the barking mastiffs and the howling crowd at the Bear Garden. He imagined old Sackerson the bear bellowing, lashing out with his claws, chained to a post, set on by dogs. A glimpse of ragged children playing in an alley filled him with thoughts of home and a pang of loneliness and shame. Before a row of brothels he saw a scabby beggarwoman with sunken nose and ulcerated shins. After years of faithful service in the stews, she has been turned out in the street to die of the pox. A chill of fear ran up his spine, and he looked away.<br>There was a pounding in his head and he felt dull and stupid. He circled many times through a maze of flyblown houses before he stumbled on the place. A servant showed him down a set of stairs. The bard descended into a hot cellar reeking of sulfur. A vast oven filled the room with flickering orange light. The sweaty heads of groaning men peered out from large wooden tubs. But the tubs were not filled with water. A sallow and emaciated man carrying iron tongs scurried round, feeding hot bricks into the tubs through a trapdoor. He poured vinegar onto the heaps of bricks and acrid steam rose up, making the glistening men within moan and shake.<br>The doctor suddenly appeared beside Will, startling him. He was sleek and prosperous, with a dainty goatee. Though he smiled reassuringly, the poet noticed that he kept a safe distance. In a soothing, urbane voice, the physician explained the treatment: stewed prunes to evacuate the bowels; succulent meats to ease digestion; cinnabar and the sweating tub to cleanse the disease from the skin. The doctor warned of minor side effects: uncontrolled drooling, fetid breath, bloody gums, shakes and palsies. Yet desperate diseases called for desperate remedies, of course.<br>Shakespeare extended a handful of silver coins. The physician took them with a gloved hand, scrutinized them carefully, and put them in his purse with the hint of a smirk. He pointed Will toward the skinny, pallid man tending bricks at the great oven. When the poet looked round again, the doctor had vanished.<br>The gaunt man tending the bricks was not quite right in the head. His hands shook, and he seemed both timorous and irritable. When he saw the poet&#x2019;s rash, he cackled and slobbered, revealing a mouth full of rotten teeth. &#x201c;Bit by a Winchester goose, eh? Ha-ha! A few good sweats will fix that, my lad. Into the powdering tub with you, then!&#x201d;<br>The poet stripped and stood ashamed, his flesh covered in scaly blots. He nervously clambered over the side of a tub, and sat down on a plank nailed to the side. Under the plank, the wooden bottom had been removed, leaving an earthen pit. The queer thin man clumsily secured a heavy lid over the top of the tub, leaving an opening just large enough for the poet&#x2019;s head. Then he popped open the trapdoor at the base of the tub and placed a hot metal plate at the poet&#x2019;s feet. He tossed red powder on the plate. The dust disappeared in a mephitic bloom of hissing fumes. The doctor&#x2019;s man repeated this again and again, until Will began to gag. A fine metallic powder settled on his body. The thin man piled hot bricks into the pit under the seat, and doused them with vinegar. As the acid waves of steam billowed upward, the bard started to tremble and sweat. This week would not be a pleasant one.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Even those who know little about Shakespeare are aware that there is a sort of controversy about the authorship of his plays. A vocal and eccentric minority doubts that a man of Shakespeare&#x2019;s background could possess literary genius, and speculates his plays were really written by an aristocrat who wished for some reason to remain anonymous. This belief rests on two snobbish and mistaken assumptions: first, that a great deal of formal education is essential for great writing; and second, that creativity depends on wealth and comfort. A good case could be made that the exact opposite is true. Many great authors were largely self-taught, and either did not attend university or dropped out. Furthermore, a dose of youthful misery may help a writer by serving as a powerful stimulus to fantasy and imagination. A recurrent biographical pattern in great writers is a happy early childhood, followed by an adolescence made insecure by financial catastrophe, the loss of a parent, or other traumas. Such was the case with William Shakespeare.<br>Shakespeare was born in April 1564, in the market town of Stratford. We know almost nothing about his mother Mary, but quite a lot about his father. John Shakespeare combined something of Falstaff&#x2019;s wit and rascality, Kent&#x2019;s stubbornness and loyalty, and Lear&#x2019;s feckless ill judgment. He made a lawful fortune from the glove trade, and an illegal one from usury and black market wool dealing. His fellow citizens liked him well enough to elect him the town&#x2019;s bailiff, an office akin to that of mayor today. However, the gossamer prosperity of the Shakespeares unraveled in William&#x2019;s teenage years, as John ran afoul of the law and lost much of his money and his lands. Elizabethan England was something between a modern constitutional monarchy and a police state. Spies and informers enforced religious orthodoxy and an oppressive system of trade regulations and monopolies. John Shakespeare was fined heavily, not only for his shady business practices, but also for his repeated failures to attend Protestant services, one of several signs that the family were probably closet Catholics.<br>If John Shakespeare once hoped to send his brilliant oldest son to get a gentleman&#x2019;s university education, near bankruptcy now made this impossible. Young Will would have studied Latin and rhetoric in the local grammar school until the age of fifteen or sixteen, probably getting more formal education than Dickens, Yeats, or Herman Melville would receive. He then may have served as a tutor in a noble Catholic household in Lancashire. By age eighteen, he was back in Stratford and hastily wed to Anne Hathaway, twenty-six years old and two months pregnant at the time of the marriage. According to tradition, Will toiled in his father&#x2019;s glove shop, and might also have moonlighted as a scrivener or a law clerk. Anne gave birth to the couple&#x2019;s daughter Susannah in May 1583, followed by the twins, Hamnet and Judith, in February 1585. Shortly thereafter, Shakespeare went to seek his fortune in London. According to a durable&#x2014;if somewhat dubious&#x2014;Stratford legend, Shakespeare was whipped for poaching deer on the lands of one Sir Thomas Lucy, a notorious persecutor of local Catholics. Will made matters worse by posting a lampoon of Lucy on his park gate, and fled town one step ahead of Lucy&#x2019;s thugs.<br>London was home to a burgeoning and intensely competitive theater scene. Some playwrights were college graduates; others, such as Shakespeare, Kyd, and Jonson, were not. Shakespeare&#x2019;s quick success, rural origins, and lack of a university degree made him the natural target of jealous attacks from the University Wits. These included Robert Greene, George Peele, and that great spendthrift of language, Thomas Nashe, a trio as noted for their depravity as for their abundant literary talents. All three would soon be dead. Their enemies blamed their passing on the pox, or syphilis, the dread disease that became a Shakespearian obsession.<br>By the early 1590s, Shakespeare had obtained the patronage of Henry Wriothesley, the Earl of Southampton. Wriothesley was an effete dandy of flexible sexuality, with a penchant for poetry. Both of Shakespeare&#x2019;s racy, best-selling narrative poems, <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and <i>The Rape of Lucrece,</i> are dedicated to him. The dedication for <i>Lucrece,</i> published in 1594, suggests that by then Shakespeare and Southamp...</p><h2>The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man (2) (A Burton &amp; Swinburne Adventure)</h2><p>Mark Hodder's second Burton &amp; Swinburne steampunk adventure, following the acclaimed The Strange Affair of Spring Heeled Jack, is filled with eccentric steam-driven technology, grotesque characters, and a deepening mystery. When a clockwork-powered man of brass is found abandoned in Trafalgar Square, Burton and his assistant, the wayward poet Algernon Swinburne, find themselves on the trail of the stolen Garnier Collection--black diamonds rumored to be fragments of the Lemurian Eye of Naga, a meteorite that fell to Earth in prehistoric times. From a haunted mansion to the Bedlam madhouse, from South America to Australia, from s�ances to a secret labyrinth, Burton struggles with shadowy opponents and his own inner demons. Can the king's agent expose a plot that threatens to rip the British Empire apart, leading to an international conflict the like of which the world has never seen? And what part does the clockwork man have to play?</p><p>Mark Hodder is the author of The Strange Affair of Spring Heeled Jack--winner of the Philip K. Dick Award 2010--and its sequel, The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man. He&#39;s the creator and caretaker of the Blakiana website (http://www.sextonblake.co.uk), which he designed to celebrate, record, and revive Sexton Blake, the most written-about fictional detective in English publishing history. A former BBC writer, editor, journalist, and Web producer, Mark has worked in all the new and traditional medias and was based in London for most of his working life until 2008, when he relocated to Valencia in Spain to de-stress and write novels. He has a degree in cultural studies and loves British history (1850 to 1950, in particular), good food, cutting-edge gadgets, cult TV (ITC forever!), Tom Waits, and a vast assortment of oddities.Praise for the Philip K. Dick Award-winning Burton &amp; Swinburne books:<br><br>"The usual superlatives for really clever fantasy (imaginative, mind-bending, phantasmagorical) aren't nearly big enough for this debut novel. With this one book, Hodder has put himself on the genre map."<br>-Booklist, starred review of The Strange Affair of Spring-Heeled Jack<br><br>"Hodder, with an encyclopedic grasp of period detail, tellingly brings these disparate, oddly familiar yet eerily different worlds to fecund life. Enthralling, dizzying, and as impressive as they come."<br>-Kirkus Reviews, starred review<br><br>"Every once in a while I come across a book, or series of books, that totally yanks the carpet out from under me. Then it reaches out, smashes me in the face with its awesomeness, and says, 'You love me!' Leaving me with naught to do but obligingly respond, 'Yes. Yes I do.' [The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man] was every bit the book that I had hoped it would be."<br>-Elitist Book Reviews<br><br>"Whatever one chooses to call [The Strange Affair of Spring Heeled Jack], it would be very difficult to deny its overwhelming brilliance. I can't remember the last time a novel has surprised, awed, and enthused me so utterly that I'm almost left at a loss for words for how to recommend it."<br>-Rob Will Review</p><h2>Getting Off: One Woman&#39;s Journey Through Sex and Porn Addiction</h2><p><b>A courageous account of one woman&#x2019;s unflinching and ultimately hopeful journey through sex and porn addiction.</b><br><br>A fixation on porn and orgasm, strings of failed relationships and serial hook-ups with strangers, inevitable blackouts to blunt the shame &#x2013; these are not things we often hear women share publicly, and not with the candor, eloquence and introspection Erica Garza brings to <i>Getting Off.</i> <br> <br>What sets this courageous and riveting account apart from your typical misery memoir is the absence of any precipitating trauma beyond the garden variety of hurt we&#x2019;ve all had to endure in simply becoming a person &#x2015; reckoning with family, learning to be social, integrating what it means to be sexual. Whatever tenor of violence or abuse Erica&#x2019;s life took on through her behavior was of her own making, fueled by fear, guilt, self-loathing, self-pity, loneliness, and the hopelessness those feelings brought on as she runs from one side of the world to the other in an effort to break her habits &#x2014;from East Los Angeles to Hawaii and Southeast Asia, through the brothels of Bangkok and the yoga studios of Bali to disappointing stabs at therapy and twelve-steps back home.<br> <br>In these remarkable pages, Garza draws an evocative, studied portrait of the anxiety that fuels her obsessions, as well as the exhilaration and hope she begins to feel when she suspects she might be free of them. And yet there is no false or prepackaged sense of redemption here. Even her relationship with the man she will ultimately marry seems credibly, painfully rocky as it finds its legs with several false starts. Erica&#x2019;s increasing sense of self-acceptance and peace by journey&#x2019;s end feels utterly earned, and absent of recovery platitudes.<br> <br>In exploring the cultural taboos surrounding sex and porn from a female perspective, Garza offers a brave and necessary voice to our evolving conversations about addiction and the impact that Internet culture has had on us all.</p><p>Born in Los Angeles to Mexican parents, Erica Garza has spent most of her adult life traveling and living abroad.

Living rooms were adorned with framed pictures of Jesus or the Virgin, and everyone believed in heaven and hell&#x2014;not as abstract ideas, but as very real places. It was the kind of place where you could pick up your holy candles with your milk and bread at the local supermarket and you always knew someone celebrating a baptism or First Communion soon&#x2014;giant events requiring ornate outfits and tres leches cake and a sense of relief on everyone&#x2019;s part that things were good with God, no one was going to hell just yet.<br> <br>I rarely met anyone who wasn&#x2019;t Catholic. When it did happen, it was whispered about. Did you know Mrs. Gonzalez is a Jehovah&#x2019;s Witness? Isn&#x2019;t that weird? If you weren&#x2019;t Catholic, to whom would you turn for help? No priest? No Bible? It was unclear how a person could distinguish right from wrong without the Commandments. And I didn&#x2019;t even want to think of what happened to them after death. I imagined babies dying before they were baptized and shuddered at their unfortunate fates.<br> <br>I often tell people now that I come from LA, or sometimes East LA if I want to hint at my Latino roots. LA is Hollywood glamour, money, and prestige; East LA screams danger, gangs, and irrefutable street cred. In truth, my life had neither. Montebello and all Southeast LA, home to cities like Bell Gardens, Pico Rivera, and Norwalk, were small, mediocre, boring.<br> <br>My dad, a mortgage broker, helped low-income Mexicans buy first homes, while my mom, a housewife, made sure our home was intact. They balanced their checkbooks, and we bought clothes at Ross, and the only place we traveled to outside of the country was Tijuana, which my mom often said &#x201c;didn&#x2019;t count&#x201d; since it was only two hours south. My brother, Gabe, and I ran through sprinklers in the summer or laid down giant plastic trash bags for slipping and sliding. Katie Wilkins, a white girl, lived next door to us, which was rare in a predominately Mexican neighborhood, and I&#x2019;d often peer at the swimming pool in her backyard from my bedroom window with envy. Mediocrity, which I felt was directly connected to my heritage, was my first source of shame.<br> <br>But, in retrospect, we seem more privileged than I realized. I vacationed in Hawaii and Walt Disney World. I attended private Catholic school, from kindergarten through high school. My dad owned and ran a mortgage company for nearly twenty years until he sold it for a large sum and bought himself his dream car, a flashy Corvette that looked like the Batmobile, and a vacation condo in Maui. And by the time I entered high school we had moved into a house with a pool. I never knew what it was to go to bed hungry or face eviction, but shame has a way of being irrational. I looked at our life and I wanted more.<br> <br>I simply couldn&#x2019;t understand why my parents would want to live in such a boring place. There seemed to be nothing but strip malls and taco stands, nail salons and bail bonds. But to them, and to other Mexicans, Montebello was a big deal. In the late sixties and early seventies, when they were growing up, Montebello was nicknamed &#x201c;the Mexican Beverly Hills.&#x201d; Housing prices were more expensive and the streets were safer than those in nearby East LA, where my mom spent her formative years. Tomas Benitez, the Chicano author and activist, said in an interview with LA&#x2019;s KCET, &#x201c;Montebello was mythic when I was growing up in the 1970s. It was the place where middle-class Mexican-Americans lived and came from. It had that quality, if you could get out of East LA, Montebello was Nirvana, the promised land and Beverly Hills East all rolled into one location.&#x201d;<br> <br>For my dad, who was born under modest circumstances in Mexico City and whose own father was an orphan, to be able to live in the Mexican Beverly Hills as an adult was a big step up. He played golf at the city&#x2019;s country club every weekend and served as an important figure in the city&#x2019;s Rotary International organization. We often ran into people who knew and respected him wherever we went&#x2014;restaurants, the bank, the supermarket&#x2014;and they&#x2019;d shake his hand with sincerity, reassuring me and my older brother, &#x201c;Your dad&#x2019;s a good man,&#x201d; in case we ever doubted it.<br> <br>My mom, on the other hand, was less interested in the community. She often complained about the city&#x2019;s lack of good stores and its seemingly endless pavement. Sometimes she even complained about its propensity for attracting wetbacks, always laughing after this admittance, especially if my dad was around, before she&#x2019;d lovingly touch his arm and coo, &#x201c;Aww, I married a wetback.&#x201d;<br> <br>That term wetback, coined from those Mexicans who illegally crossed the Rio Grande to get to America, was not an accurate description of my dad, who had crossed the border legally and traveled by road, not river. But that didn&#x2019;t stop my mom from muttering the word whenever she was feeling playful, or worse, when she was feeling wicked. Even though she has Mexican roots herself, I always thought that her teasing meant she considered natural-born citizens superior to those who had been naturalized. She would have likely picked this idea up from her own dad, a WWII veteran whose own parents were immigrants, and whose dark skin made him feel inferior in a country that was even harsher toward Mexicans than it is today.<br> <br>The problem, for me, was that my neighborhood and my place inside it didn&#x2019;t resemble my preconceived notions of power. It didn&#x2019;t matter that my classmates at school shared the same Spanish-sounding last names and most of their grandmas didn&#x2019;t speak English either. I took note of the Mexican guy selling oranges on the corner, and the busboy picking up our dishes topped with messes of ketchup and crumbs, and I thought, No, that&#x2019;s not me. I even convinced myself now and again that I was superior to those kinds of Mexicans because my parents hadn&#x2019;t taught me Spanish. We were outgrowing our Mexican-ness, I thought to myself. Pretty soon it would be gone completely, forgotten like a dream.<br> <br>My feelings of superiority never lasted long. I knew my classmates and I were part of a minority, and I didn&#x2019;t like the sound of that word, sitting heavy in my mouth and mind. I wanted to be like the blond-haired, blue-eyed Tanner girls on Full House. I wanted the calm, sensible family talks like the Seavers had on Growing Pains. I wanted a family tree that stretched back to Europe. Maybe England or Ireland, France even. But not Spain.<br> <br>I got hooked on TV at a young age, marking the beginning of my intense bond with screens, and TV served as a window into the exciting world out there. I became obsessed with the families and neighborhoods I saw that were different from my own&#x2014;which is to say, white. There was no George Lopez on TV then, no Sofia Vergara or America Ferrera. And I deemed the world &#x201c;out there,&#x201d; on the TV screen and in the heart of glittering Hollywood, to be far superior to the Mexican Beverly Hills with its baldheaded gangsters, its teenage mothers, and its paleta men making their living selling sweet treats to kids on clean, suburban pavement.<br> <br>Unlike my dad, who seemed perfectly content with his roots and his chosen city of Montebello, I leaned more toward my mom&#x2019;s chronic dissatisfaction and her fondness for escape. Like me, my mom also found herself captivated by screens. She loved foreign films&#x2014;Cinema Paradiso, Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, Shirley Valentine&#x2014;and I&#x2019;d cuddle up with her on the couch for countless cinematic escapes, placing myself in the films and imagining the adventures waiting for me in adulthood.<br> <br>Sometimes I would imagine taking trips with my mom. It&#x2019;s not that I didn&#x2019;t love my dad or that I wanted her to leave him forever, but maybe a few months? A year? I picked up on the tension that arose between my parents if my dad was working late again or on another client call. He usually returned from the office when we were already tucked into bed and was gone in the morning before we&#x2019;d had a chance to get up, always trying to get ahead at the expense of my mom&#x2019;s growing resentment. My brother and I got used to having my dad around only on the weekends. But even then there were always more phone calls, more stacked files in front of him, and my mom found this difficult to accept, alternating between giving him the silent treatment and erupting in angry outbursts, depending on her mood.<br> <br>My mom&#x2019;s moodiness became more pronounced as I grew older. Some days she&#x2019;d park herself in front of the TV, bored eyes glazed over by some daytime talk show or murder mystery. Other days she&#x2019;d take me to the mall to try on clothes and feast at the food court, deep-fried corn dogs with mustard and curly french fries. And yet other days she&#x2019;d be annoyed by everything&#x2014;the dirty dishes, the piles of laundry, her lazy children&#x2014;and I&#x2019;d think to myself, She just needs a break. If we go away for a little while, she&#x2019;ll feel better.<br> <br>When my mom was upset, I sought solace in playing video games with Gabe, who was three years my senior. We spent hours toting machine guns in Contra, gobbling up mushrooms in Super Mario Bros., and scouring mythic lands for Zelda. I became obsessed with trying to beat him, frantically studying video-game magazines to learn the latest cheats, training myself not to blink, lest I miss a bullet or fireball and lose. When I wasn&#x2019;t playing, I was thinking of playing. When I was playing, I was thinking of what I&#x2019;d play next.4<br> <br>When we weren&#x2019;t saving princesses in front of the TV screen, Gabe and I were putting ourselves on the screen, acting out short films he wrote and directed&#x2014;he&#x2019;d decided early on he was going to be a famous filmmaker when he grew up. Gabe&#x2019;s gift for screenwriting and his skillfulness with my parents&#x2019; camcorder earned him a lot of admiration. Family parties invariably involved the screening of a movie Gabe was making with my cousins and me as actors, typically toward the end of the night when our parents were tipsy and jovial.<br> <br>I came to resent what I saw as Gabe&#x2019;s creative genius, even when my mom encouraged my rising interest in writing, buying me books and journals that I filled mostly with complaints about my brother intermingled with praise for all the boys I had crushes on at school. And whenever she caught me complaining about something being unfair, she&#x2019;d murmur, smiling, &#x201c;All the best writers had rough childhoods.&#x201d;<br> <br>When Gabe didn&#x2019;t want to play with me, I&#x2019;d terrorize him with kicks and shoves until he&#x2019;d eventually shove me back, at which point I&#x2019;d run crying to my mom in hopes he&#x2019;d get punished. When she&#x2019;d reprimand him, her long, curly hair shaking wildly around her face, I&#x2019;d stand behind her, laughing and waving my hands at him, thinking, I win! She loves me more than you!<br> <br>Despite my mom and dad&#x2019;s persistent praise of Gabe, I clung desperately to the idea that my mom loved me more. We were girls, after all, and this meant something. That&#x2019;s why she let me skip school and lie lazily in bed with her some days, watching movies and eating popcorn, saying, Don&#x2019;t tell Dad I let you skip again. I loved keeping secrets with her.<br> <br>One night, when I was ten years old, my parents told us kids we&#x2019;d have dinner in our fancy dining room. I was confused. My dad rarely made it to dinner. I thought the dining room was reserved for Thanksgiving and Christmas only. And were those candles?<br> <br>I had heard the word divorce slither out of my mom&#x2019;s mouth on a few occasions when she was gossiping about my uncle&#x2019;s ex-wife, or when she was talking about certain kids&#x2019; parents at school, and I wondered to myself if this is what was happening. Were my parents treating my brother and me to one final moment of togetherness before my dad packed up his suitcase? Would we be divided between them? Clearly I&#x2019;d stay with my mom. And then, immediately after, I wonder where we&#x2019;ll travel to first.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your dad and I have some big news,&#x201d; my mom said, an excited smile on her face. A glass tumbler sat in her hand, filled to the brim with Pepsi and ice cubes, and she took gentle sips, letting suspense build around the table.<br> <br>I looked at my dad, and he was smiling too.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Gabe said.<br> <br>I kept my mouth shut, feeling excited yet guilty. Had I actually willed this into happening? Did all my imaginings of traveling the world with my mom come to fruition simply because I thought them? I considered the gravity of what this meant, that I had the power to destroy my parents&#x2019; marriage with my mind. I pictured myself as some kind of witch, a source of power and wickedness.<br> <br>&#x201c;You want to tell them?&#x201d; my mom asked my dad.<br> <br>&#x201c;OK,&#x201d; he said, and I held my breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your mom&#x2019;s going to have a baby!&#x201d;<br> <br>My mom exploded in giggles, the ice cubes in her Pepsi clanking against the glass while she stood up to give me and my brother kisses and hugs. But when she pulled me close to her, my face pressed against her cotton blouse, I burst into tears.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, baby, why are you crying? What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; She tried to pull away to look at my face, but I clung tight, digging my nails into her arm, refusing to let go. &#x201c;Erica, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>I heard my brother laugh, confused by my reaction. And I felt my dad come over beside us and put his warm hand on my quivering head. But I didn&#x2019;t know how to explain the panic I felt at being cast aside, overshadowed by Gabe&#x2019;s talent and the importance of a brand-new baby, and so I lied when they asked again, &#x201c;Erica, why are you crying?&#x201d;<br> <br>Finally, I answered, &#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m happy.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>I can remember, vividly, the sexual fantasies that bubbled in my brain, seemingly out of nowhere, during my mom&#x2019;s pregnancy. To distract myself from thinking about my new sibling, I turned my attention to other, more captivating places and daydreamed constantly. There&#x2019;s nothing like the bulging belly and emotional intensity of a pregnant woman to inspire curiosity about how it all works&#x2014;babies, sex, the origin of life.<br> <br>All I had ever heard about sex from my parents came from my mom when, passing the local high school, she pointed out a few pregnant girls who couldn&#x2019;t have been older than sixteen and said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ever let that happen to you&#x201d;&#x2014;and then, pointing to my crotch&#x2014;&#x201c;don&#x2019;t let anyone ever touch you down there.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mom and dad both seemed uncomfortable when it came to addressing sex, and they were equally as aggressive about hiding it from me.5 When things got hot and heavy in whatever movie we were watching, the response was immediate: &#x201c;Close your eyes until we say,&#x201d; and I complied, listening to the indistinct sounds of what I was not allowed to see until it was all over.<br> <br>I can understand my parents&#x2019; reluctance at not wanting to talk about sex with me at ten years old, but &#x201c;the talk&#x201d; never came.6 Sex was something dirty and sinful, something to blush about, something to hide. These were obviously inherited ideas. My grandparents on both sides had the same reactions when a love scene unexpectedly danced across the TV screen: a shriek of discomfort followed by covered eyes and the demand that somebody change the damn channel. Whether it was a Latino thing7 or a Catholic thing, I couldn&#x2019;t be sure. Even my teachers laughed uncomfortab...</p><h2>C.Z.

Z. Guest: American Style Icon</i>&nbsp;lives up to its name on every imaginable level and then goes on to deliver a genuinely endearing and personal portrait depicting a woman who is legendary and remains unforgettable. This is a book that one returns to over and over again as the subject and her sphere of influence in the worlds of fashion and style will be remembered for generations to come.&nbsp;<i>C. Z. Guest: American Style Icon</i>&nbsp;should be given as a gift to those who are interested in learning the true definitions of grace and style." ~<i>NY Journal of Books</i><br><br>"...Author, designer, and Today Show contributor Susanna Salk provides a tantalizing glimpse into the world of Boston socialite C.Z. Guest. While Guest embodied, even defined, WASP style&#x2014;doting on dogs and horses, perfecting her tennis game, and being the consummate hostess&#x2014;she, as Salk puts it, &#x201c;bucked at the expectations of her own clich�, constantly surprising with modern gestures that somehow never felt scandalous.

And each tale is better than the next." ~<i>One Kings Lane</i><br><br>"True style icons are few and far between but C.Z. Guest ranks at the top of American qualifiers. More than merely beautiful and stylish, the essence of her status emanated from within, expressing her zest for life across the board. She was the alluring embodiment of seemingly disparate worlds. And it is this fascinating dichotomy that Susanna Salk captures so wonderfully in her new volume from Rizzoli.&nbsp;With contributions from an impressive cast of both A-listers and intimates who knew her best, we are painted a portrait of a woman both of and ahead of her time, whose interests ranged from Mainbocher to Madonna from pups and ponies to Dali and discos. And yet C.Z. was never more or less than herself. So completely comfortable and confident, she never tried nor needed to impress. She remained true to her classic Boston brahmin style, exuding an enviable elegance that was both timeless and chic." ~<i>Quintessence.com</i></p><h2>Invisible Allies</h2><p>After his expulsion from Russia, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn secretly worked on a memoir that would acknowledge the courageous efforts of the people who hid his writings and smuggled them to the West. Before the fall of Communism, the very publication of Invisible Allies would have put these friends in jeopardy.<br>Now we are finally granted an intimate account of the extensive, ever-shifting network of individuals who risked life and liberty to ensure that Solzhenitsyn's works were kept safe, circulated in samizdat, and "exported" via illicit channels. These imperiled conspirators, often unknown to one another, shared a devotion to the dissident writer's work and a hatred of the regime that brought terror to every part of their lives. The circle included scholars and fellow writers and artists, but also such unlikely operatives as an elderly babushka who picked up and delivered manuscripts in her shopping bag.<br>With tenderness, respect, and humor, Solzhenitsyn tells us of the fates of these partners in intrigue: the women who typed distribution copies of his works late into the night under the noses of prying neighbors; the correspondents and diplomats who covertly carried the microfilmed texts across borders; the farflung friends who hid various drafts of Solzhenitsyn's works anywhere they could - under an apple tree, beneath the bathtub, in a mathematics professor's loft with her canoe.<br>In this group of deftly drawn portraits, Solzhenitsyn pays tribute to the anonymous heroes who evaded the KGB to bring The Gulag Archipelago and his many other works to the world.</p><p>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was born in 1918 and grew up in Rostov-on-Don. He graduated in physics and mathematics from Rostov University and studied literature by correspondence course at Moscow University. In World War II he fought as an artillery officer, attaining the rank of captain. In 1945, however, after making derogatory remarks about Stalin in a letter, he was arrested and summarily sentenced to eight years in forced labour camps, followed by internal exile. In 1957 he formally rehabilitated, and settled down to teaching and writing, in Ryazan and Moscow. The publication of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich in Novy Mir in 1962 was followed by publication, in the West, of his novels Cancer Ward and The First Circle. In 1970 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and in 1974 his citizenship was revoked and he was expelled from the Soviet Union. He settled in Vermont and worked on his great historical cycle The Red Wheel. In 1990, with the fall of Soviet Communism, his citizenship was restored and four years later he returned to settle in Russia. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn died in August 2008.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Mexico Set (Samson)</h2><p><p>Long-awaited reissue of the second part of the classic spy trilogy, GAME, SET and MATCH, when the Berlin Wall divided not just a city but a world.</p><p>A lot of people had plans for Bernard Samson...</p><p>When they spotted Erich Stinnes in Mexico City, it was obvious that Bernard Samson was the right man to &#x2018;enrol&#x2019; him.

But somehow we can&#x2019;t seem to apply it in our daily lives. We continue to see Him as a small-minded bookkeeper, tallying our failures and successes on a score sheet. Yet God gives us His grace, willingly, no matter what we&#x2019;ve done. We come to Him as ragamuffins&#x2014;dirty, bedraggled, and beat up. And when we sit at His feet, He smiles upon us, the chosen objects of His &#x201c;furious love.&#x201d; Brennan Manning&#x2019;s now-classic meditation on grace and what it takes to access it&#x2014;simple honesty&#x2014;has changed thousands of lives. It will change yours, too.</p><p>Brennan Manning wrote <i>The Ragamuffin Gospel</i> "for the bedraggled, beat-up, and burnt-out," the marginalized folks to whom Jesus ministered: the children, the ill, the tax collectors, the women. In other words, the ragamuffins. Manning understands better than most that behind our facades of order and self-assurance are inadequacies that can find healing only in Jesus. While the powerful and religious elite challenged him, Jesus embraced and healed and fed the needs of the ragamuffins. Jesus delivered love, healing, and, most of all, grace.<p> Grace is defined as "the freely given and unmerited favor and love of God." But, as Manning points out, we have "twisted the gospel of grace into religious bondage and distorted the image of God into an eternal, small-minded bookkeeper." In reality, God offers us grace immeasurable. Brennan Manning gently encourages us to embrace that grace in the face of our greatest needs. And Manning certainly knows whereof he speaks, having taken a journey from priesthood and academic achievement through a collapse into alcoholism. Manning came face to face with his need, finally abandoning himself to grace. And he invites us now to join him in a life of grace.</p><p> Manning is without doubt one of the most eloquent writers on the subject of grace because he openly shares his own pain and struggle to help readers deal with failure and inadequacy. And he sweetly challenges them to do the same. <i>--Patricia Klein</i></p><p><strong>Brennan Manning</strong> is often on the road, speaking of God's unconditional love at church retreats and conferences.

After nine years in Jesuit schools, he went to Edinburgh University, receiving a degree in medicine in 1881. He then became an eye specialist in Southsea, with a distressing lack of success. Hoping to augment his income, he wrote his first story, <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>. His detective, Sherlock Holmes, was modeled in part after Dr. Joseph Bell of the Edinburgh Infirmary, a man with spectacular powers of observation, analysis, and inference. Conan Doyle may have been influenced also by his admiration for the neat plots of Gaboriau and for Poe&#x2019;s detective, M. Dupin. After several rejections, the story was sold to a British publisher for �25, and thus was born the world&#x2019;s best-known and most-loved fictional detective. Fifty-nine more Sherlock Holmes adventures followed. Once, wearying of Holmes, his creator killed him off, but was forced by popular demand to resurrect him. Sir Arthur&#x2014;he had been knighted for this defense of the British cause in his The Great Boer War&#x2014;became an ardent Spiritualist after the death of his son Kingsley, who had been wounded at the Somme in World War I.

For over 700 years the international language of science was Arabic. Surveying the golden age of Arabic science, Jim Al-Khalili reintroduces such figures as the Iraqi physicist Ibn al-Haytham, who practised the modern scientific method over half a century before Bacon; al-Khwarizmi, the greatest mathematician of the medieval world; and Abu Rayhan al-Biruni, a Persian polymath to rival Leonardo da Vinci.

Isabel Monfort writes what she knows--the history of her family and Quintin's family, dating back to the turn of the 20th century. When Quentin discovers the work in progress, he is dismayed at her factual errors and unhappy that she reveals so many family secrets. Every couple of chapters, Quintin interrupts Isabel's narrative to tell his version of events and worry aloud about his marriage. At first, he tries not to let his wife know he's reading the novel, but soon he cannot resist writing comments in the margins. This "he said/she said" format allows Rosario Ferr� to explore sexual divisions in Puerto Rican society and evaluate the blurred boundaries between fact and fiction. <p> Ferr� also examines Puerto Rico's severe economic and racial divisions in evocative ways. She describes when Quintin's sisters were children, and they grew weary of playing with one of the servant's babies--the two girls decided it might be more fun if the baby were white, so they painted her. The lead paint made the infant deathly ill, and she had to be rushed to the hospital. "Another half an hour of being white, and Carmelina would have died." Isabel remarks.</p><p> At times this book is confusing because there are so many characters to keep track of, but the family tree at the beginning of the text makes it a bit easier to follow. Isabel is an engaging narrator who has plenty of racy and tragic stories to tell. <i>The House on the Lagoon</i> is a fascinating introduction to Puerto Rican history and culture. <i>--Jill Marquis</i></p><p>Rosario Ferr� is the author of&nbsp;The House on the Lagoon, a National Book Award finalist,&nbsp;Eccentric Neighborhoods, and&nbsp;Sweet Diamond Dust.

My brother Duncan had turned on every light in the house to welcome us, and each window beamed the message into the fog as he emerged from the front door to give me a bone-crushing bear hug. He was more gentle with Mum. We had been delayed for an extra day in Leicester with the lawyers, as some last-minute paperwork failed to arrive in time and had to be sent up the M1 on a motorbike. Duncan had masterminded the movement of all Mum&#x2019;s furniture from Surrey in three vans, with eight men who had another job to go to the next day. The delay had meant a fraught standoff in the entryway to the park, with the previous owner&#x2019;s lawyer eventually conceding that Duncan could unload the vans, but only into two rooms (one of them the fetid front kitchen) until the paperwork was completed. <br><br>So the three of us picked our way in wonderment between teetering towers of boxes and into the flagstoned kitchen, which was relatively uncluttered and, we thought, could make a good center of operations. A huge old trestle table I had been hoarding in my parents&#x2019; garage for twenty years finally came into its own, and was erected in a room suited to its size. It&#x2019;s still there as our dining-room table, but on this first night its symbolic value was immense. Some boxes and carpets Duncan had managed to store in the back pantry had just been flooded, so while he unblocked the drain outside I drove to a Chinese takeout I&#x2019;d spotted on the way from Route A38, and we sat down to our first meal together in our new home. Our spirits were slightly shaky but elated, and we laughed a lot in this cold, dark, chaotic house on that first night, and took inordinate comfort from the fact that at least we lived near a good Chinese place. <br><br>That night, with Mum safely in bed, Duncan and I stepped out into the misty park to try to get a grip on what we&#x2019;d done. Everywhere the flashlight shone, eyes of different sizes blinked back at us, and without a clear idea of the layout of the park at this stage, the mystery of exactly what animals lurked behind them added greatly to the atmosphere. We knew where the tigers were, however, and made our way over to one of the enclosures that had been earmarked for replacement posts to get a close look at what sort of deterioration we were up against. With no tigers in sight, we climbed over the stand-off barrier and began peering by flashlight at the base of the structural wooden posts holding up the chain-link fence. We squatted down and became engrossed, prodding and scraping at the surface layers of rotted wood to find the harder core, in this instance reassuringly near the surface. We decided it wasn&#x2019;t so bad, but as we stood up were startled to see that all three tigers in the enclosure were now only a couple of feet away from where we were standing, ready to spring, staring intently at us. Like we were dinner. <br><br>It was fantastic. All three beasts &#x2014; and they were such glorious beasts &#x2014; had maneuvered to within pawing distance of us without either of us noticing. Each animal was bigger than both of us put together, yet they&#x2019;d moved silently. If this had been the jungle or, more accurately in this case, the Siberian tundra, the first thing we'd have known about it would have been a large mouth around our necks. Tigers have special sensors along the front of their two-inch canines that can detect the pulse in your aorta. The first bite is to grab, then they take your pulse with their teeth, reposition them, and sink them in. <br><br>As they held us in their icy glares, we were impressed. Eventually, one of these vast, muscular cats &#x2014; acknowledging that due to circumstances beyond their control (i.e., the fence between us), this had been a mere dress rehearsal &#x2014; yawned, flashed those curved dagger canines, and looked away. We remained impressed. <br><br>We started back toward the house. The wolves began their eery night chorus, accompanied by the sounds of owls &#x2014; there were about fifteen on site &#x2014; the odd screech of an eagle, and the nocturnal danger call of the vervet monkeys as we walked past their cage. This was what it was all about, we felt. All we had to do now was work out what to do next.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Album of Anthony Powell&#39;s Dance to the Music of Time</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

Unlike the majority of his colleagues, he worked in Bengali rather than Hindi (the dominant language of his country), and he made quietly intelligent, liberal humanist films rather than raucous four-hour musicals, the popular staple. This collection of his occasional writings on Indian and foreign films, published in India in 1976, reflects his humanist concerns. In the course of such essays as ``What Is Wrong with Indian Films?'' and ``The Odds Against Us,'' he repeatedly argues for a cinema about personal problems and large issues, a cinema that is perhaps a little too content-based for the tastes of many critics. The pieces, which date from 1948 to 1974, include several lovely reminiscences and journal excerpts from his filmmaking days; in fact, the best material describes working and traveling at home and abroad. Unfortunately, the book and film reviews that make up the bulk of the volume are disappointingly ordinary; he has little new to say about Akira Kurosawa, John Ford, or the other directors he admires. On occasion, Ray will rise up in a manifesto-like tone, urging Indian filmmakers to draw on their own social reality rather than following foreign models, however admirable. At those moments, his prose catches fire again. Rather than issuing this collection of often indifferent material, Hyperion would have done a greater service to Ray's memory by publishing more of his working journals or reminiscences. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

When police officers arrived at the site, they called in Chatters, a deputy coroner and scientist. At first glance, Chatters guessed that the skull was that of a white pioneer, perhaps a hundred or so years old, but on examining other skeletal remains, he began to suspect that the human eventually dubbed "Kennewick Man" was much older indeed. Various scientific tests proved him right: the skeleton was around 9,500 years old. But Kennewick Man, he announced, was also "Caucasoid" in appearance, a revelation that triggered charges of racism and tomb-robbing by local Native Americans, who claimed the remains as part of their cultural heritage. The announcement also drew in white supremacists, who seized on Chatters's discovery to argue that their forebears were the first to arrive in North America.</p><p> Both the term "Caucasoid" and its racially charged interpretations were off the mark, Chatters writes, for Kennewick Man should be seen as an ancestor to us all. Some of his features, and those of other ancient remains found elsewhere in the Americas, suggest a kinship with peoples as various as Polynesians, Ainu, medieval Icelanders, and Australian aborigines. More important than bloodline is the revision that Kennewick Man and his cousins force in our account of the arrival of humans in the Americas, which, Chatters argues, happened in waves over long periods of time and involved people of widely varied features and genetic traits.</p><p> Writing evenly of a controversy that continues to rage, Chatters provides a behind-the-scenes view of physical anthropology, as well as a fascinating revision of the human past. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>James C.

He attended the University of Nebraska and served in the United States Army during the Spanish-American War. A successful businessman, he founded the Clason Map Company of Denver, Colorado and published the first road atlas of the United States and Canada. In 1926, he issued the first of a famous series of pamphlets on thrift and financial success, using parables set in ancient Babylon to make each of his points. These were distributed in large quantities by banks and insurance companies and became familiar to millions, the most famous being &#x201c;The Richest Man in Babylon,&#x201d; the parable from which the present volume takes its title. These &#x201c;Babylonian parables&#x201d; have become a modern inspirational classic.Originally published in 1926, sprinkled with King James English, and narrated with Shakespearean intensity by the able Richard Ferrone, this is a high- impact personal finance audio that sounds like it's speaking to us from the time of Jesus. Captivating fables gently urge listeners to use their talents to accumulate money, invest a tenth of what's earned, spend thoughtfully on necessities, save for the future, and avoid risks.

In this sharp, masterfully argued book, Dani Rodrik, a leading critic from within, takes a close look at economics to examine when it falls short and when it works, to give a surprisingly upbeat account of the discipline.</p><p>Drawing on the history of the field and his deep experience as a practitioner, Rodrik argues that economics can be a powerful tool that improves the world&#x2015;but only when economists abandon universal theories and focus on getting the context right. <em>Economics Rules</em> argues that the discipline's much-derided mathematical models are its true strength. Models are the tools that make economics a science.</p><p>Too often, however, economists mistake a model for <em>the</em> model that applies everywhere and at all times. In six chapters that trace his discipline from Adam Smith to present-day work on globalization, Rodrik shows how diverse situations call for different models. Each model tells a partial story about how the world works. These stories offer wide-ranging, and sometimes contradictory, lessons&#x2015;just as children&#x2019;s fables offer diverse morals.</p><p>Whether the question concerns the rise of global inequality, the consequences of free trade, or the value of deficit spending, Rodrik explains how using the right models can deliver valuable new insights about social reality and public policy. Beyond the science, economics requires the craft to apply suitable models to the context.</p><p>The 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers challenged many economists' deepest assumptions about free markets. Rodrik reveals that economists' model toolkit is much richer than these free-market models. With pragmatic model selection, economists can develop successful antipoverty programs in Mexico, growth strategies in Africa, and intelligent remedies for domestic inequality.</p><p>At once a forceful critique and defense of the discipline, <em>Economics Rules</em> charts a path toward a more humble but more effective science.</p></p><p>Dani Rodrik, a prize-winning economist, is the Ford Foundation Professor of International Political Economy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He is the author of The Globalization Paradox&nbsp;and&nbsp;Economics Rules.&#x201c;<em>Economics Rules</em>, by one of the world's truly great economists, describes in fascinating and incredibly well-written detail what it means to be an economist. In so doing it explains why, and when, economists often get it right, but also why they also frequently go astray.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>George Akerlof, Nobel laureate in economics</strong><br><br>&#x201c;The best economists make the best methodologists, and Dani Rodrik is both. His <em>Economics Rules</em> is the single best source for explaining the strengths and weaknesses of economics to an outside audience.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tyler Cowen, George Mason University, author of <em>The Great Stagnation</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In <em>Economics Rules</em>, enjoyment enhances learning, with lessons for economists and non-economists alike&#x2015;indeed, ten commandments for each. The book is a page-turner with every page carrying an important and memorable take-away.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Margaret Levi, director, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University</strong></p><h2>Red Star Over Hollywood: The Film Colony s Long Romance with the Left</h2><p>Until now, Hollywood&#39;s political history has been dominated by a steady stream of films and memoirs decrying the nightmare of the Red Scare. But Ronald and Allis Radosh show that the real drama of that era lay in the story of the movie stars, directors and especially screenwriters who joined the Communist Party or traveled in its orbit, and made the Party the focus of their political and social lives. The authors&#39; most controversial discovery is that during the investigations of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, the Hollywood Reds themselves were beset by doubts and disagreements about their disloyalty to America, and their own treatment by the Communist Party. Abandoned by their old CP allies, they faced the Blacklist alone.</p><p>Ronald Radosh, adjunct Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute, was the first writer to establish the guilt of Julius Rosenberg, in his best-selling book, THE ROSENBERG FILE. He is also author of COMMIES: A JOURNEY THROUGH THE OLD LEFT, THE NEW LEFT AND THE LEFT OVER LEFT.

A shadowy land of make-believe where Jack and his box are stuck beneath the bed with the dust, spiders, and other castaway toys, forced to face a bitter truth: children grow up and toys are left behind. Jack believes this is the worst that can happen to a toy.<br><br>But when the Plucker, a malevolent spirit, is set loose upon the world of make-believe and Jack is thrust into the unlikely role of defending Thomas, the very child who abandoned him, he finds out there is worse that can befall a toy-far worse. As desperation mounts, Jack is thrown together with Thomas's other toys-Monkey, the Nutcracker, and the ethereally beautiful porcelain doll Snow Angel-as they struggle to rise above their simple roles as playthings in an effort to save the boy they love.</p><p>Over the past few decades, Brom has lent his distinctive vision to all facets of the creative industries, from novels and games to comics and film. He is the author of<i>&nbsp;Lost Gods,&nbsp;Krampus the Yule Lore,</i>&nbsp;<i>The Child Thief and the award-winning illustrated horror novels&nbsp;<i>The Plucker&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Devil's Rose</em></i><em>. Brom is currently kept in a dank cellar somewhere just outside of Seattle.</em></i>Grade 5 Up&#x2013;If the Velveteen Rabbit had a satanic bent, it would have much in common with the Plucker, the spirit doll that young Thomass father brings him from Africa in 1942. In Broms fevered imagination, the love and imaginative play with which children imbue their toys&#x2013;their gusto, as he terms it&#x2013;can be sucked out and turned to evil purposes, destroying the soul of the child and enlivening creatures too horrible to contemplate. It is up to Thomass old Jack-in-the-box to prevent the boy from such vitiation. Aided by the herbal and hoodoo wisdom of Mabelle, Thomass stalwart old nurse, and a few other plucky cast-off toys, Jack challenges the monstrous Foulthings spawned by the Plucker and vanquishes its malevolence. Broms descriptive powers are revealed equally in his prose and his illustrations. The paintings are so detailed and so layered that they yield their secrets further the more closely they are examined. Poring over them is an exercise in fascinated revulsion. Almost every page&#x2013;from the opening, What the hell? to the resolution&#x2013;contains abominations calculated to stir up nightmares. Despite its bittersweet, triumphant ending [...] this book will stir discomfort everywhere it goes. Brom is surely aware of this, as he is photographed on the dust jacket, poised to consume an eviscerated teddy bear with an oversize fork and spoon. Not everyone will be amused, and not everyone should be exposed to this macabre tour de force.<i>&#x2013;Miriam Lang Budin, Chappaqua Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Inexpensive materials and a repertoire of imaginative techniques form the crux of his decorating philosophy, one that celebrates innovative reinterpretations of traditional styles and encourages all to design and create their own dramatic and distinctive interiors.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> Principles of Decoration </p><p> <b><i>Getting Ideas</i></b> </p><p> Since every room is different, each has its own starting point for decorating ideas. The quality of light varies from room to room, for reasons like the ceiling height and the number of windows. Some rooms may contain furnishings that you cannot fit anywhere else. </p><p> All these limiting factors are in fact departure points for creating a scheme. In the Style Directory you will see rooms that are in turn cluttered, sparsely furnished and that appear small and large. Each one makes a strong visual statement, which can sometimes mask a problem, or sometimes make a virtue out of necessity. </p><p> <b><i>Transforming a room</i></b> </p><p> I created a new decorative scheme for the sitting room in a late-nineteenth-century house, shown in the snapshot below. In the bottom right-hand corner of the facing page you can see how the style of this room was reinterpreted in the flavor of the Arts and Crafts movement of the time, taking into account some of the inspirational materials that appear on these pages. </p><p> <b><i>Historical Colors</i></b> When you are choosing a scheme to decorate, you may want to use period colors. Several companies produce special ranges of paints in "historical" colors but these are not always accurate. The manufacturers usually rely on analyses of paint scrapings, which can be misleading because over time pigments can change color. And, until this century, painters had no standard formulations for making up colors, and shades of a color often varied depending on the local materials used. So trying to match the <i>exact</i> subtle shade of what you think is an authentic color might well be a fruitless task! Instead, it is better to think of approximations and, as I often do in choosing paints, of colors that simply suggest a period. Here is some source material for historical colors (clippings, reproduction fabric and wallpaper) along with standard modern paint chips in similar colors. </p><p> <b><i>Dividing Wall Space</i></b> </p><p> Once some of the ideas for decorating your room have come together -- maybe a period atmosphere you want to convey, the level of formality you require, or a completed color scheme -- start thinking about how you are going to articulate the wall Space that you have before you. </p><p> A wall is like an empty canvas, which can be treated in any number of ways for different effects. Even though walls are fiat, and the most usual treatment of them is two-dimensional, the overall effect of the wall decoration is much more powerful than that of floors or ceilings. This is because walls wrap around a room, enclosing the space between them. By manipulating the wall space, using division, color and line as your tools, you can alter the character of a room. </p><p> Historically, walls have been subject to a number of horizontal divisions such as cornices and dado rails. These can be used separately or together, in similar or complementary colors to the wall, for different effects. The dado (the area between a baseboard and dado rail) is the place to make grand statements by using colors, textures and patterns that are different to the upper wall. </p><p> <b><i>Floors and ceilings</i></b> </p><p> When planning how to decorate the walls, think also about the floor and ceiling. The floor color can work in tandem with the wall color, either complementing or strengthening its effect, or it can be an entirely different color, and act independently in the scheme. </p><p> Ceilings can also "float" independently from other structures in a room, although the color of a ceiling can affect both the room's apparent height and lightness. </p><p> <b><i>Structural Features</i></b> </p><p> Period moldings help to structure a wall and enrich the decoration of a room. If you have a home in which cornices, friezes, dado rails or baseboards have been partly ripped out during modernization, then a local lumber mill will often match your existing moldings and make up an exact quantity of "specials" for you. </p><p> <b><i>Starting afresh</i></b> </p><p> If your home has no authentic features left to restore (or they are beyond repair), simply use moldings that are commercially available, where necessary combining them to imitate more complicated period moldings. Not only is this cheaper than having specials run up, it can also be just as effective. </p><p> All the room slices in the Style Directory were put together using materials and moldings that were currently available from lumber and building suppliers. </p><p> Historically, there has been a finite number of molding patterns used in Western interior decoration. These have changed only in their scale and combination from one period to the next. </p><p> Modern manufacturers produce most standard period moldings in many different sizes, which allows you to choose elements to suit your room. Some moldings, with cross-sections, are shown here. </p><p> <b><i>Using Rhythm</i></b> </p><p> The most underrated technical effect available when decorating, is visual rhythm, which can bounce some life into a room. Its use provides a rich vein to be tapped, and one that has been neglected too long, since enriched decoration fell from grace in the early part of the twentieth century. </p><p> At its simplest, rhythmic decoration can be two symmetrically placed windows in a room, which you decide to dress up and show off, or it might be two matching mirrors placed in a prominent and symmetrical position. This has a visually satisfying effect because it defines and emphasizes the space between and on either side of the two features. </p><p> <b><i>Repeated images</i></b> </p><p> At its most complicated and diffused, rhythm can be seen in wallpapers and fabrics, sending off little repeats in all directions. Images or motifs, repeated so that they pulse around a room, set up an obvious rhythm and act as a meter by which all the components of the room can be judged. The strength of its impact depends on the scale of the images you use and the number of repeats in relation to the size of the room. </p><p> <b><i>Horizontal rhythms</i></b> </p><p> Sometimes, as in the examples opposite, the most obvious and exciting rhythms are those that run in just one direction, horizontally around the room. Their energies are not dissipated and they follow the architecture of the room. They are also all placed at cornice height so the repeated motifs can be clearly seen and do not become confused with any other decoration in the room. It is important that furniture, wallhangings and people do not get in the way of the flow of the pattern, or the rhythm will cease. </p><p> <b><i>Styles of Lighting</i></b> </p><p> There are two ways in which you can make artificial lighting work for you. The first is to double up on light sources, by fitting, for example, wall lights <i>and</i> table lamps - as many as possible. The second is to fit several separate circuits in a room so that, at the most, only two lamps occupy a single circuit. For simplicity, all the lights should be controllable from a wall-mounted switch and each circuit fitted with a dimmer switch, so you can choose where and exactly by how much to illuminate your room. </p><p> You can also experiment with ways of adapting natural light, for example by partially covering a window with muslin or oiled paper to screen bright sunlight, or soften harsh winter light. </p><p> <b><i>Types of artificial light</i></b> </p><p> The range of electric lighting available for the domestic market is enormous. Traditional, incandescent bulbs are now making way for all kinds of new and small fluorescent bulbs and "daylight" quality tubes. Your choice of artificial light can affect the color of your room. Standard tungsten bulbs, for example, cast a warm yellowish light, while "daylight" bulbs cast a harder, colder light. </p><p> <b><i>Lighting, Color &amp; Mood</i></b> </p><p> The most common assumptions made about the colors of rooms are misleading. For example, the most light-reflective and cheerful colors are not just pale peach and apricot, as is popularly believed, but also bright yellow and lavender blue. If you try to modulate the atmosphere of a scheme simply by lightening its color, you run the risk of introducing more light at the expense of the setting's character. </p><p> Before choosing a color, consider whether you spend more time in a room by day or in the evenings. Most color schemes look good under artificial lighting. If your problem is a dingy room by day, try adding mirrors and complementary colors (see p.336) before you consider using a pale color scheme. </p><p> In the setting shown on these pages, the brown version (below) is most arcane and interesting. By day it is less light-reflective (bottom), but the color responds well to daylight and makes the room seem warm and inviting. The pale scheme (right and far right), on the other hand, is less appealing by day, when it seems relatively cold and lifeless, but at night, by candlelight, it becomes magical. </p><p> <b><i>Whole House Treatments</i></b> </p><p> Decorating should be fun land enjoyable. It does not always involve major restructuring, nor should it, since in every sense of the word it is a superficial activity. All the room sets in this book are broad interpretations of styles from different countries and periods. They are not historical documents, and each one could look at home in half a dozen different types of house of different ages. If you decorate with a sense of fun, you will appreciate this. </p><p> <b><i>Developing a theme</i></b> </p><p> But how can you take an idea that you like for one room, and then decorate the whole house? What will give your home an identity that can assume different guises in different rooms? </p><p> The need for this variation is obvious, since we are different people when we are entertaining, to when we are in private rooms such as the bathroom or bedroom, to when we come home from work: and accordingly we make different demands on our environment. But equally, homes are single dwelling units, and far too many people decorate their homes as though the rooms were hermetically sealed and independent of each other. </p><p> On these pages are shown the three thematic principles to bear in mind when decorating a whole house, namely color, materials and period. Using just one of them as a criterion will help you formulate a look for the inside of your house that should have some integrity. If you are able to use all three together, and make all the rooms conform by color, materials and period, your home will grow in character even more. </p><p> <b><i>Period homes</i></b> </p><p> Decorating a period house can be fraught with crises of conscience. Is what you are doing right for the period of the building? Are you using the correct materials and colors? Or if what you are doing is not authentic, only interpretive, does it respect the fabric and character of the building? </p><p> <b><i>How to decide</i></b> </p><p> These questions are valid to some extent, particularly in valuable old houses. But decorating is a private activity and its aim is personal enjoyment; it has always reflected the tastes of individuals, not public bodies, and it should remain so. The most important consideration facing anyone decorating a period home is not what should or should not be added, but what should or should not be taken away. </p><p> The answer is to remove as little as possible of the original structure because whatever is added to a building in terms of moldings and paint is reversible, but original features, once ripped out, cannot easily be replaced. The domestic vandalism of many nineteenth-century homes during the 1950s and 1960s has meant that what is now being replaced is often inaccurate and out of tune with what was probably there originally. </p><p> <b><i>Choosing &amp; Enjoying Decoration</i></b> </p><p> I hope that you find the Style Directory to be a useful source of inspiration for rich and exciting decorative treatments. All the components of each treatment are analyzed so you can select either the complete scheme or particular features of it for your own room. I suggest various ways to style the look and show how optional colorways will look for walls, floors, furniture and fabrics. </p><p> <b><i>Decorating for yourself</i></b> </p><p> A great deal of satisfaction can be drawn from learning the decorating skills necessary to complete your own scheme. You will find them all in the second half of the book where there is detailed coverage of every technique used as well as the tools and materials you will need. </p><p> For quick reference, there are tables on pages 324-31 which show you the composition, properties and uses of the various types of paint, varnish and pigment used in the book. Some techniques require you to mix your own paints (or adapt manufactured ones), and recipes are given on pages 332-3. This is followed by advice on buying and storing materials, and tips on calculating quantities. Terms used in the book are briefly explained on pages 336-9 and finally there is a list of useful suppliers of tools and accessories. </p><p> Text copyright � 1990 by Kevin McCloud</p></p><h2>Three Philosophical Poets: Lucretius, Dante, Goethe (Barnes &amp; Noble Rediscovers Series)</h2><p>Used.

Diane Maddex, who has written several books on Wright, has assembled a photographic collection of his living and dining rooms as well as playrooms, libraries, and a few public spaces, including Wisconsin&#39;s Johnson Wax building and the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Wright&#39;s signature style--a combination of arts and crafts and the &#34;prairie school&#34;--was achieved by designing human-scale spaces with beautifully crafted materials. Maddex includes the finest examples of this in the book. The rooms span Wright&#39;s entire career--from the Robie House in 1906 to the Guggenheim, which was completed in 1959 (after the architect&#39;s death)--and they demonstrate the evolution of his style. The photographs are sensational; they capture the light, scale, and color of each interior. Accompanying each photo is a brief description of the clients, their requirements, and what Wright created for them. This is a lovely book that serves as a beautiful historical record of one of the 20th century&#39;s greatest architects.</p><h2>Five Children and It (Looking Glass Library)</h2><p>What would you do if you could wish for anything in the world? In E. Nesbit&#x2019;s classic middle-grade tale of adventure and mayhem, five children discover a Psammead, a grumpy magical creature with the ability to grant wishes. At first, their newfound power seems exciting and full of promise, but soon the children realize that getting what you wish for can land you in a whole heap of trouble! This Looking Glass Library edition includes an introduction by Laurel Snyder and line illustrations from the original 1902 publication.</p><p>E. Nesbit (1858&#x2013;1924) is the beloved author of nearly 40 books, including <i>Five Children and It, The Phoenix and the Carpet, </i>and <i>The Story of the Amulet.</i>*&nbsp; CHAPTER 1&nbsp; *<br><br>Beautiful as the Day<br><br>The house was three miles from the station, but before the dusty hired fly had rattled along for five minutes the children began to put their heads out of the carriage window and to say, "Aren't we nearly there?" And every time they passed a house, which was not very often, they all said, "Oh, is this it?" But it never was, till they reached the very top of the hill, just past the chalk quarry and before you come to the gravel pit. And then there was a white house with a green garden and an orchard beyond, and Mother said, "Here we are!"<br><br>"How white the house is," said Robert. <br><br>"And look at the roses," said Anthea.<br><br>"And the plums," said Jane. <br><br>"It is rather decent," Cyril admitted. <br><br>The Baby said, "Wanty go walky"; and the fly stopped with a last rattle and jolt.<br><br>Everyone got its legs kicked or its feet trodden on in the scramble to get out of the carriage that very minute, but no one seemed to mind. Mother, curiously enough, was in no hurry to get out; and even when she had come down slowly and by the step, and with no jump at all, she seemed to wish to see the boxes carried in, and even to pay the driver, instead of joining in that first glorious rush round the garden and the orchard and the thorny, thistly, briery, brambly wilderness beyond the broken gate and the dry fountain at the side of the house. But the children were wiser, for once. It was not really a pretty house at all; it was quite ordinary, and Mother thought it was rather inconvenient, and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the ironwork on the roof and coping was like an architect's nightmare. But the house was deep in the country, with no other house in sight, and the children had been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of fairy palace set down in an earthly paradise. For London is like prison for children, especially if their relations are not rich.<br><br>Of course there are the shops and the theatres, and Maskelyne and Cook's, and things, but if your people are rather poor you don't get taken to the theatres, and you can't buy things out of the shops; and London has none of those nice things that children may play with without hurting the things or themselves--such as trees and sand and woods and waters. And nearly everything in London is the wrong sort of shape--all straight lines and flat streets, instead of being all sorts of odd shapes, as things are in the country. Trees are all different, as you know, and I am sure some tiresome person must have told you that there are no two blades of grass exactly alike. But in streets where the blades of grass don't grow, everything is like everything else. This is why so many children who live in towns are so extremely naughty. They do not know what is the matter with them, and no more do their fathers and mothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, tutors, governesses, and nurses; but I know. And so do you now. Children in the country are naughty sometimes, too, but that is for quite different reasons.<br><br>The children had explored the gardens and the outhouses thoroughly before they were caught and cleaned for tea, and they saw quite well that they were certain to be happy at the White House. They thought so from the first moment, but when they found the back of the house covered with jasmine, all in white flower, and smelling like a bottle of the most expensive scent that is ever given for a birthday present; and when they had seen the lawn, all green and smooth, and quite different from the brown grass in the gardens at Camden Town; and when they had found the stable with a loft over it and some old hay still left, they were almost certain; and when Robert had found the broken swing and tumbled out of it and got a lump on his head the size of an egg, and Cyril had nipped his finger in the door of a hutch that seemed made to keep rabbits in, if you ever had any, they had no longer any doubts whatever.<br><br>The best part of it all was that there were no rules about not going to places and not doing things. In London almost everything is labeled "You mustn't touch," and though the label is invisible it's just as bad, because you know it's there, or if you don't you jolly soon get told.<br><br>The White House was on the edge of a hill, with a wood behind it--and the chalk quarry on one side and the gravel pit on the other. Down at the bottom of the hill was a level plain, with queer-shaped white buildings where people burnt lime, and a big red brewery and other houses; and when the big chimneys were smoking and the sun was setting, the valley looked as if it was filled with golden mist, and the limekilns and oasthouses glimmered and glittered till they were like an enchanted city out of the Arabian Nights.<br><br>Now that I have begun to tell you about the place, I feel that I could go on and make this into a most interesting story about all the ordinary things that the children did--just the kind of things you do yourself, you know--and you would believe every word of it; and when I told about the children's being tiresome, as you are sometimes, your aunts would perhaps write in the margin of the story with a pencil, "How true!" or "How like life!" and you would see it and very likely be annoyed. So I will only tell you the really astonishing things that happened, and you may leave the book about quite safely, for no aunts and uncles either are likely to write "How true!" on the edge of the story. Grown-up people find it very difficult to believe really wonderful things, unless they have what they call proof. But children will believe almost anything, and grown-ups know this. That is why they tell you that the earth is round like an orange, when you can see perfectly well that it is flat and lumpy; and why they say that the earth goes round the sun, when you can see for yourself any day that the sun gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night like a good sun as it is, and the earth knows its place, and lies as still as a mouse. Yet I daresay you believe all that about the earth and the sun, and if so you will find it quite easy to believe that before Anthea and Cyril and the others had been a week in the country they had found a fairy. At least they called it that, because that was what it called itself; and of course it knew best, but it was not at all like any fairy you ever saw or heard of or read about.</p><h2>The War in the Air (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>A cornerstone of early science fiction and a haunting image of world war</b><br><br>Following the development of massive airships, na�ve Londoner Bert Smallways becomes accidentally involved in a German plot to invade America by air and reduce New York to rubble.

The housekeeper&#39;s reputation is one built on dependable efficiency, though she is something of an oddity. Stubborn, foul-mouthed and with a flagrant disregard for her employer&#39;s opinions she may even be crazy. She allows no-one to set foot inside her house; she masks herself with a veil and is equally guarded about her personal life. And yet Emerence is revered as much as she is feared. As the story progresses, her energy and passion to help becomes clear, extinguishing any doubts arising out of her bizarre behaviour. A stylishly told tale which recounts a strange relationship built up over 20 years between a writer and her housekeeper. After an unpromising and caustic start, benign feelings develop and ultimately the writer benefits from what becomes an inseparable relationship. Simultaneously we learn Emerence&#39;s tragic past which is revealed in snapshots throughout this book.</p><p>Magda Szabo was born in 1917 in Debrecen, Hungary.

Well after the Civil War, Charlotte's whites and blacks, workers and business owners, all lived intermingled in a "salt-and-pepper" pattern. The rise of large manufacturing enterprises in the 1880s and 1890s brought social and political upheaval, however, and the city began to sort out into a "checkerboard" of distinct neighborhoods segregated by both race and class. When urban renewal and other federal funds became available in the mid- twentieth century, local leaders used the money to complete the sorting out process, creating a "sector" pattern in which wealthy whites increasingly lived on one side of town and blacks on the other.<br><br></p><p>"This is a southern story of the emergence of mercantile, industrial, banking, and real estate entrepreneurs and how they shaped a city in an era of black disenfranchisement, Jim Crow, and the waning political power of white workers. . . . [Hanchett] provides a broad context for understanding that the shape of our cities is far from happenstance."-- <i>Southern Cultures</i> <br>Traces the spatial evolution of Charlotte, NC, from 1875 to 1975 exploring the national and local influences that brought about racial and economic segregation.</p><h2>The Brave Escape of Edith Wharton</h2><p>This book examines the life and career of the American author, Edith Wharton.</p><p><b>Product Description</b><br> Edith Wharton, author of <i>Ethan Frome, The House of Mirth, </i>and other acclaimed novels, was born into a wealthy family. Beginning in childhood, Edith found ways to escape from society's and her family's expectations and follow an unconventional, creative path. Unhappily married and eventually divorced, she surrounded herself with male friends. She spent much of her life in Paris and was recognized by the French government for her generosity and hard work during World War I. Her literary and personal life, her witty and incisive correspondence, her fondness for automobiles and small dogs--all are detailed in this warm and sparkling account of a woman well ahead of her time. <i>Includes a bibliography, source notes, and an index.</i> <br> <br> <br> <p> <b>Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Connie Nordhielm Wooldridge, Author of <i>The Brave Escape of Edith Wharton</i></b> </p> Dear Amazon Readers,<p></p> A good book always makes me curious about the person who wrote it. That happened in a big way when I finished Edith Wharton's novel The House of Mirth. After I read the biographical sketch on the back cover and the dedication, I was more curious than ever and started devouring everything I could find about her.<p></p> I'd read plenty of books about people who escaped from poverty to pursue their dreams. What I discovered about Edith Wharton was that she escaped from a life of wealth and luxury to pursue hers: New York society women of the Gilded Age didn't work, and they most certainly didn't write fiction. Edith Wharton defied the expectations foisted upon her to become a best-selling, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning novelist who made a terrific living with her pen. Why were there no books for young people about this courageous, fascinating woman?<p></p> Since I was a writer of picture books, I decided to try my hand at a short piece about her escape from society's expectations. But something else I discovered started pulling me another way. As an adult, Edith Wharton left the United States for Paris and found herself living there when World War I broke out. She should have decamped to England and waited things out in a luxurious country home she'd rented there. She chose instead to remain in Paris, endure the privations of the war years, and lay her writing aside in order to open a number of charities where orphans, refugees, and victims of tuberculosis could be cared for. I had the thought that maybe I should focus my picture book on her war work.<p></p> I pored over old letters in research libraries, visited Wharton's summer home in Lenox, Massachusetts, and found myself pulled in more and more directions. I began to think that I needed more room than a thirty-two-page book would give me--that I would have to write a full-length biography to tell Edith Wharton's story properly. But I was a picture book writer, a teller of very short, focused nonfiction tales. Should I defy the expectations I had imposed on myself and try this new thing? The answer was obvious: If Edith Wharton had the courage to strike out into uncharted territory, how could her would-be biographer do anything less?<p></p> So it was Edith Wharton's books that first drew me to her. But it was her determination to follow her writer's call, as well as her rich, well-lived life, that led me out of my own comfort zone and inspired me to write <i>The Brave Escape of Edith Wharton</i>.<p></p> I'd love to introduce you to Edith Wharton. As her writer friend Henry James observed, "You will find nothing stupid in her and nothing small." <p></p> Sincerely,<br> <i>Connie Nordhielm Wooldridge</i> <p></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> <i>The Mount</i>--Edith Wharton's Estate in Lennox, MA </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br> (<i>The Mount</i> photo � David Dashiell) <br><p><b>Connie Nordhielm Woold</b>ridge received a master's degree in education and library science from the University of Chicago.

Fulfilled by Amazon, satisfaction guaranteed.</p><p>TOM WILLIAMS was born in Newcastle in 1981 and was educated at University College London. He now lives in Kentish Town and works in publishing. A Mysterious Something in the Light is his first book.&#39;Outstanding... Williams writes sensitively about the Cissy relationship, and delves illuminatingly into the composition of Chandler&#39;s masterpieces... But he also commands a broader sweep, detailing the real-life criminal conspiracies and financial scams that lay behind Chandler&#39;s depiction of 1920s oil-boom Los Angeles as a pit of corruption... thanks to this biography Chandler himself is a less mysterious something than he was&#39; -- John Carey The Sunday Times &#39;Absorbing... Chandler was a man in need of a friend - and in his biographer he finds one... There&#39;s so much here that&#39;s interesting and poignant... The end of his story is sad beyond words&#39; -- Sam Leith Spectator &#39;A lovely biography written by an enthusiast for the fiction with sympathy for the life, without being misty-eyed&#39; Sunday Herald &#39;Smashing... Certainly, by the end, its subject was completely smashed&#39; Prospect &#39;Chandler&#39;s life was tattered and unwieldy, filled with rage and frustration: his only consolation lay in filtering it all through his typewriter, so that it was transformed into his wry and magical prose... This new biography ... is a good starting point for those who can&#39;t resist a peek past the glittering stage-set of an author&#39;s work to the tawdry mess that so often lies beyond&#39; -- Craig Brown Mail on Sunday - Book of the Week &#39;Strongly researched and highly readable&#39; -- Andrew Klavan Wall Street Journal &#39;Despite the belligerence and arrogance detailed in this book, Williams writes with a cool, detached hand, allowing many previously unseen letters to speak for themselves... a lucid and taut examination of the first &#34;hard boiled&#34; writer to turn populist pulp writing into a more erudite art form&#39; Sunday Express &#39;Tom William is the third and best biographer of Chandler... his packed, insightful, entertaining biography will, I feel, be the last on Chandler ... a difficult and lonely man who led a dissatisfied and disappointed life&#39; -- Marcel Berlins The Times &#39;Excellent&#39; -- Ron Capshaw American Book Review &#39;Williams&#39; book paints an intriguing portrait of a man in fragments&#39; -- Xan Brooks Guardian &#39;The most comprehensive biography of Chandler written to date&#39; Western Morning News &#39;Precise, kindly and necessary&#39; Scotland on Sunday &#39;A thorough exploration of the writer who defined modern crime fiction&#39; The List &#39;A thoroughly enjoyable read which blends Chandler&#39;s life with history, keeping it lively and entertaining&#39; welovethisbook.com &#39;Succeeds in making a serious case for Chandler as an important, or at least an aspirant, modern... Williams is absolutely on the money&#39; -- Brian Morton The Herald &#39;We are used nowadays to fictional detectives who can rarely win, because the crimes they investigate are only a small part of an evil system they can&#39;t completely fathom. This is Marlow&#39;s recurring plight. He was a pioneer sufferer from the paranoia about power and corruption that we all now live with. Thanks to this biography we know much more than we did before about the talented but unhappy man who created him&#39; -- John Hinton Catholic Herald &#39;Tom Williams creates a portrait of an author as mysterious and troubled as any fictional character, and provides a fascinating new insight into a rare and exacting genius, in this impressive piece of literary detective work&#39; Good Book Guide &#39;Williams&#39;s biography reminds us that as a man Chandler was a psychological mess, but as a writer he remains an enchanter&#39; -- Michael Dirda Times Literary Supplement &#39;Tom William&#39;s biography helps us to understand a complicated and dislikeable man&#39; The Oldie &#39;The most comprehensive biography of Chandler written to date&#39; Western Morning News &#39;Williams does not flinch from describing his subject&#39;s faults but he lets his enthusiasm for the books shine through ... he knows the value of letting Chandler speak for himself&#39; -- Jake Kerridge Daily Telegraph &#39;This biography is the best all-round portrayal of the troubled California writer&#39; The Rap Sheet</p><h2>Southern Discomfort (Deborah Knott Mysteries)</h2><p>Deborah Knott may have lost the district election, but a bigoted judge&#39;s sudden death - and some old-fashioned political horse trading - have won her a governor&#39;s appointment. True to Southern form, her swearing-in is followed by a raucous reception that brings out every elderly aunt and cousin in the county. Unfortunately, Lu Bingham, the force behind WomanAid, is at the reception, too. Not only has she come to collect the leftovers for her daycare center, but she&#39;s also there to collect on one of Deborah&#39;s more extravagant campaign promises. Before Deborah can say, &#34;If elected..&#34;. she is committed to putting her muscle where her mouth was, spending weekends with an all-woman crew as the group attempts to build its first house for a needy single mom. Old stereotypes die hard. Herman Knott, one of Deborah&#39;s numerous brothers, has to be hectored and cajoled before he&#39;ll give reluctant permission for his daughter and novice electrician Annie Sue to wire the house. Nor does it help that the county building inspector is a swaggering chauvinist nit-picker who&#39;s more interested in scoring with the young women than scoring their work. Chaos erupts before the house is even half-finished. On the same rainy summer night that Herman collapses on the side of the road from an apparent heart attack, Annie Sue is found battered and half-naked in the deserted structure. Has she been raped? Who left her in that condition? And whose blood is that on Deborah&#39;s own hammer? Dwight Bryant, an old childhood friend (and a bit of a good ol&#39; boy), is a modern and efficient police detective, but it is Deborah who must judge whether dark secrets in her own family have led to murder. And if so, reveal the darkermore troubling reasons why.</p><p>MARGARET MARON grew up on a farm near Raleigh, North Carolina, but for many years lived in Brooklyn, New York. When she returned to her North Carolina roots with her artist-husband, Joe, she began a series based on her own background. The first book, Bootlegger's Daughter, became a Washington Post best-seller that swept the major mystery awards for its year and is among the 100 Favorite Mysteries of the Century as selected by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. Later Deborah Knott novels Up Jumps the Devil, Storm Track, and Three-Day Town each won the Agatha Award for Best Novel. In 2008, Maron received the North Carolina Award for Literature, the state's highest civilian honor. And in 2013, The Mystery Writers of America celebrated Maron's contributions to the mystery genre by naming her a Grand Master-an honor first bestowed on Agatha Christie. In 2016, she was inducted into the North Carolina Literary Hall of Fame. To find out more about the author, you can visit MargaretMaron.com.

Murder rears its ugly head only after shared family stories and relationships establish a stylistic context. Employing her intimate knowledge of the place, Knott discovers who assaulted her teenage niece and killed a randy building inspector inside an unfinished WomenAid house.

WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, TO CHANGE THINGS FOR THE BETTER WHEREVER WE CAN. AND IF IT TAKES A LONG PUSH, THEN WE'RE IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL. A LOT OF TIMES THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE GENIUS OF THE MOMENT. IT'S ABOUT PERSISTENCE. IT'S ABOUT BEING IN THERE AND STAYING IN THERE."</blockquote><p>Since the early sixties, musicians have put themselves on the line for the causes they believed in, raising public awareness about important issues through songs, rallies, and benefit events. For more than thirty years, musician David Crosby has been one of rock 'n' roll's most outspoken voices for social change. in <em>Stand and Be Counted,</em> he and coauthor David Bender recount the stories of the artists who made a difference and the passionate convictions that moved them. Crosby's personal participation and his friendships with many of the artists involved give readers a behind-the-scenes look at events from the civil rights marches and antiwar moratoriums of the sixties, to the antinuclear events of the seventies, to Live Aid and the Amnesty International events of the eighties--right up to the Tibetan Freedom concerts of today.</p><p>This compelling story includes new interviews with such diverse artists as Harry Belafonte, Whoopi Goldberg, Adam Yauch, Phil Collins, Robin Williams, Eddie Vedder, Joan Baez, and Jimmy Buffett. Poignant and inspirational, <em>Stand and Be Counted</em> is an unforgettable document of the history of activism in late twentieth-century America.</p></p><p><p>David Crosby of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young is a pioneering musician and twotime inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as the founding member of the Byrds and Crosby, Stills, and Nash. He coauthored the bestselling <em>Long Time Gone.</em></p><p>David Bender is a founding contributing editor of George magazine. A longtime political activist and benefit producer, he is also the author of a novel, <em>The Confession of 0.J. Simpson: A Work of Fiction.</em></p><p>Before you turn the page and begin reading, let me say two things right up front. The first is that <i>Stand and Be Counted</i> is not about me. Although these stories of activism are told from my perspective, that fact is not meant to imply anything more than the truth which is that I've been privileged to witness some amazing, even pivotal, musical events. I played at some of them myself; the rest I've done my best to describe based on the accounts of artists and others who were there.</p><p>The second thing I need to say is that this book does not, pretend to be a history text. It would be impossible to recount fully the whole scope of artist activism in this country, let alone the world. Whether it's Jackson Browne's annual benefit concerts for the Verde Valley School to fund scholarships for Native American students, or Mimi Farina's Bread &amp; Roses events that support her organization's work with shut-ins, the disabled, and prisoners, or Paul Simon's Children's Health Fund that provides mobile health services to impoverished kids, or Billy Joel's work on behalf of the Long Island fishermen, or Pete Seeger's sloop, the Clearwater, which sails the Hudson River as a floating classroom on environmental protection, the list of artists and their commitments is as long as you want to make it. Because of the constraints of space, I must apologize in advance for having to leave out many important efforts. Rather than attempting to list every event and every concert, I've included stories that are meant to give a sense of the wide range of activism in which artists are involved. Sometimes well-chosen stories can provide more insight into a subject than a perfectly detailed chronology. And speaking of chronology, the narrative of Stand and Be Counted will occasionally jump around in time because I felt it was more important to follow the people and the story than the calendar.</p><p>The purpose of <i>Stand and Be Counted</i> is to convey an ethic. It is my hope that the stories of these great events-the marches, the rallies, the benefit concerts--will offer a glimpse of where that ethic of activism came from, how it's grown over the years, what it's accomplished, and how it's been transmitted down the line. And I want to show how it affects the lives of those who try to live by it.</p><p>A final note: while <i>Stand and Be Counted</i> has been written in my voice, that voice is actually a composite of two people, myself and my friend and coauthor, David Bender. From volunteering as a twelve-year-old to work on Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign, to marching in the moratoriums against the war, to producing many benefit events himself, David has been a dedicated activist for over thirty years. As much as mine, his insights and experiences inform the narrative of this book.</p><p>All of my life I've been thrilled by people being courageous. That's always been a thing that really excited me. When I became conscious of the fact that people were standing up against the system, standing up against injustice, that there were people who would fight for what they believed in, it aroused in me a great need to know.</p><p>I wanted to know, why they did it. I understood the emotional desire to be courageous. I felt that. But I wanted to know how they got to there. Did someone teach them? Is it a thing that just occurs? Is it spontaneous combustion? What puts a person in the path of oncoming evil, standing there courageously saying, "No, I will not submit." What does that? I asked a lot of my friends, which is what I do. I asked my friend David Bender and he and I started to think about writing a book.</p><p>Taking a stand shows a depth of character and a generosity of spirit. It shows the quality in human beings that makes me proud to be one. And that's really what we're after here.</p><p>We'll follow people. We'll witness tales of tragedy and tales of courage. And we'll try to give you a feeling for how this all came about. When you get done reading this you'll know that Pete Seeger is a national treasure, and that every single musician in this entire country was affected by him, all of us, every single one.</p><p>You'll also realize that if we had any smarts at all, we would have run Harry Belafonte for president years ago, just because he's brilliant and lucid and he's a walking history book. And he has more dignity than any human being I've ever met. Hopefully you'll also get a glimpse into something else. There isn't an instruction booklet for any of this. There isn't a manual of how to become an activist. We learn it by watching people we admire stand up for what they believe in.</p><p>Musicians rightfully are entertainers. Our main job is to make you feel good, make you feel something, make you feel. That's really, what we do. But there's another, older part of our job that comes from the tradition of the troubadours. We're sort of the town criers, the "twelve o'clock and all is well" kind of guys. Or maybe it's 11:30 and things aren't so damn good.</p><p>We've been carrying those messages for hundreds of years. It's a very tricky balance. First of all you have to be very careful. You have to have your information right. And you can't preach. It just won't work. But you can focus people's attention on issues and ideas; and we've learned that you can use music to gather people together for a cause. </p></p><h2>Balance Benders Beginning</h2><p>Move over Sudoku, here come balance Benders! you can use these books as quick, fun logic problems or as stepping stones to success in algebra.

Violence finds him anyway when he becomes the only witness to a murder. Though Nell Healey shot her husband in cold blood, Jury will go to any lengths to help her, including taking sick leave from Scotland Yard to investigate. Calling on his old friend Melrose Plant for help, he must break through Nell&#x2019;s reticence to untangle a web of twisted motives&#x2014;and twisted lives....</p></p><p>Martha Grimes is the bestselling author of eighteen Richard Jury mysteries and also the acclaimed fiction <b>Foul Matter</b>, <b>Cold Flat Junction</b>, <b>Hotel Paradise</b>, <b>The End of the Pier</b>, and <b>The Train Now Departing</b>. <p> </p>Set in West Yorkshire and Cornwall, this story challenges Martha Grimes&#39;s major character, Superintendent Richard Jury, to find out the real reason that a perfectly sane and patient wife should murder her husband ten years after their only child has been kidnapped and presumably killed. The abridgment, written by Jill Ellyn Riley, provides a smooth narrative flow without any obvious gaps or lapses and with more than a few touches of characterization and byplay not always found in abridgments. Tim Curry&#39;s narration is consistent and expressive: he handles character voicing well but has some trouble with Yorkshire and Baltimore accents. T.T.B.

He studied law in Paris before settling in England where he married an Englishwoman, and he spent most of his writing career living in Great Britain. Widely regarded as one of the greatest Golden Age mystery writers, his work featured apparently impossible crimes often with seemingly supernatural elements. He modelled his affable and eccentric series detective Gideon Fell on G. K. Chesterton, and wrote a number of novels and short stories, including his series featuring Henry Merrivale, under the pseudonym Carter Dickson. He was one of only two Americans admitted to the British Detection club, and was highly praised by other mystery writers. Dorothy L. Sayers said of him that &#39;he can create atmosphere with an adjective, alarm with allusion, or delight with a rollicking absurdity&#39;. In 1950 he was awarded the first of two prestigious Edgar Awards by the Mystery Writers of America, and was presented with their Grand Master Award in 1963.

The tortoise--slow and steady--won the race, right? So why, when it comes to weight loss and fitness, does everyone want to be the hare, speeding toward the finish line in a desperate attempt to drop pounds in record time? In <i>Lose It Right</i>, fitness consultant and writer James Fell offers the cold, hard truth about what you really need to do to lose weight and get fit. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his trademark irreverent style, Fell offers a slow, steady and science-based approach to improving health that will motivate and inspire readers. He explains the critical role of exercise in adopting healthy eating behaviours, and provides a step-by-step road map for integrating exercise and making dietary changes. Through the Virtuous Cycle, a leveled eating and exercise program, Fell shows you how to gradually transform your health, the way your body performs, and the way you look. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With its big-picture approach to lifestyle planning, and its insistence that there are no quick fixes or miracle cures, <i>Lose It Right</i> will appeal to readers who suspect the tortoise was right: slow and steady really does win the race.</p><p><p>JAMES FELL&nbsp;is the author of the syndicated column &#x201c;In-Your-Face Fitness&#x201d; for the <i>Chicago Tribune, </i>and interviews celebrities about their fitness regimens for the <i>Los Angeles Times. </i>He is senior fitness columnist for <i>Chatelaine.com</i> and <i>AskMen.com</i>.

Life is made up of enjoyable work, long, lazy weekends, and the company of good neighbors. Then, to their shock, construction starts on the vacant lot next door, a wooded hillside they'd believed would always remain undeveloped. Disappointed by their diminished privacy, Colquitt and Walter soon realize something more is wrong with the house next door. Surely the house can't be "haunted," yet it seems to destroy the goodness of every person who comes to live in it, until the entire heart of this friendly neighborhood threatens to be torn apart.</p></p><p>Anne Rivers Siddons is a writer of literary fiction whose one foray into the horror genre is this remarkable 1978 novel, <i>The House Next Door</i>. The setting is a wealthy suburb in Atlanta where an ambitious young architect is building a dramatically contemporary house. The novel uses a frame device to put three short stories under a single cover: as each of three families moves into the house in succession, we watch the bad things that happen to them and eventually force them to leave. But the frame itself--the observations of an urbane and sophisticated couple who live next door and become close friends with the architect--is the most deeply involving story in the book.<p> Stephen King was so impressed by <i>The House Next Door</i> that when he wrote <i>Danse Macabre</i>, his personal tour of the horror genre, he sought out Siddons for an interview. She told him, "The haunted house has always spoken specially and directly to me as the emblem of particular horror. Maybe it's because, to a woman, her house is so much more than that: it is kingdom, responsibility, comfort, total world to her.... It is an extension of ourselves; it tolls in answer to one of the most basic chords mankind will ever hear.... So basic is it that the desecration of it, the corruption, as it were, by something alien takes on a peculiar and bone-deep horror and disgust." </p><p> Siddons was also fascinated by how the supernatural has the power to disturb the complacent rich and their comfortable little world: "What has the unspeakable and the unbelievable got to do with second homes and tax shelters and private schools for the kids and a p�t� in every terrine and a BMW in every garage? Primitive man might howl before his returning dead and point; his neighbor would see, and howl along with him.... The resident of Fox Run Chase who meets a ghoulie out by the hot tub is going to be frozen dead in his or her Nikes on the tennis courts the next day if he or she persists in gabbling about it. And there he is, alone with the horror and ostracized on all sides. It's a double turn of the screw." </p><p> One caveat: some people find the ending a false note that mars the effect. Even so, <i>The House Next Door</i> is an exquisite horror novel. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p><b>Anne Rivers Siddons</b> was born in a small railroad town just south of Atlanta, where her family has lived for six generations. She attended Auburn University and later joined the staff of <i>Atlanta</i> magazine. Her first novel, <i>Heartbreak Hotel,</i> a story of her college days at Auburn, was later made into a movie called <i>Heart of Dixie,</i> starring Ally Sheedy. Since then she has written fifteen more novels, many of which have been bestsellers. Recently, a movie version of her later novel <i>The House Next Door</i> was aired on LifeTime Network. Ms. Siddons now divides her time between Atlanta and Brooklin, Maine.</p><h2>The oil painter&#39;s guide to painting skies</h2><p>Over 175 illustrations and a concise text that covers the entire range of oil techniques give the artist step-by-step instruction.</p><p></p><h2>Sociology</h2><p>This text, by using five key concepts (social structure, culture, power, functional integration and social action), aims to show students the diversity of sociology, while avoiding the pitfall of presenting sociology as though it were divided by competing perspectives. This approach encourages critical thinking that shows how sociologists can both share an approach and still see different dimensions of a problem. This edition emphasizes cross-cultural understanding and social issues, exploring the relationship between global and local. It shows students how international factors shape life in the US and how social action in the US shapes international issues like the drug trade or the state of the environment. A new chapter (&#34;The Third World&#34;) gives examples of how social action is bringing about development in South Korea. A major new section on the environment discusses rain forests, air pollution and water pollution. The book aims to show how research and analysis informs the choices that people face both in everyday life and in public policy. Its focus on &#34;visual sociology&#34; teaches students how to look at the world around them through new eyes by presenting graphic images as a basic part of sociology. An instructor&#39;s manual is also available (0-07-037939-4).</p><p>Growing up in Chicago at a time when neighborhoods were going through transitions in ethnic and racial composition, Richard T. Schaefer found himself increasingly intrigued by what was happening, how people were reacting, and how these changes were affecting neighborhoods and people&#x2019;s jobs. His interest in social issues caused him to gravitate to sociology courses at Northwestern University, where he received a B.A. in Sociology. "Originally as an undergraduate I thought I would go on to law school and become a lawyer. But after taking a few sociology courses, I found myself wanting to learn more about what sociologists studied and fascinated by the kinds of questions they raised." This fascination led him to obtain his M.A. and Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Chicago. Dr. Schaefer&#x2019;s continuing interest in race relations led him to write his masters&#x2019; thesis on the membership of the Ku Klux Klan and his doctoral thesis on racial prejudice and race relations in Great Britain. Dr. Schaefer went on to become a professor of sociology. He has taught introductory sociology for 30 years to students in colleges, adult education programs, nursing programs, and even a maximum-security prison. Dr. Schaefer&#x2019;s love of teaching is apparent in his interaction with his students. "I find myself constantly learning from the students who are in my classes and from reading what they write. Their insights into the material we read or current events that we discuss often become part of future course material and sometimes even find their way into my writing." Dr. Schaefer is author of the third edition of Sociology: A Brief Introduction (McGraw-Hill, 2000). Dr. Schaefer is also the author of Racial and Ethnic Groups now in its eighth edition, and Race and Ethnicity in the United States, second edition. His articles and book reviews have appeared in many journals, including American Journal of Sociology, Phylon: A Review of Race and Culture, Contemporary Sociology, Sociology and Social Research, Sociological Quarterly, and Teaching Sociology. He served as president of the Midwest Sociological Society in 1994-1995. Dr. Schaefer&#x2019;s advice to students is to "look at the material and make connections to your own life and experiences. Sociology will make you a more attentive observer of how people in groups interact and function. It will also make you more aware of peoples&#x2019; different needs and interests &#x2014; and perhaps more ready to work for the common good, while still recognizing the individuality of each person."</p><h2>Rest in Pieces</h2><p>Mrs. Murphy thinks the new man in town is the&nbsp;&nbsp;cat's meow....

Heroic young men carry the emotional weight of their lives to war in Vietnam in a patchwork account of a modern journey into the heart of darkness</p><p><i>"They carried all the emotional baggage of men who might die. Grief, terror, love, longing--these were intangibles, but the intangibles had their own mass and specific gravity, they had tangible weight. They carried shameful memories. They carried the common secret of cowardice.... Men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to."</i><p> A finalist for both the 1990 Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award, <i>The Things They Carried</i> marks a subtle but definitive line of demarcation between Tim O'Brien's earlier works about Vietnam, the memoir <i>If I Die in a Combat Zone</i> and the fictional <i>Going After Cacciato</i>, and this sly, almost hallucinatory book that is neither memoir nor novel nor collection of short stories but rather an artful combination of all three. Vietnam is still O'Brien's theme, but in this book he seems less interested in the war itself than in the myriad different perspectives from which he depicts it. Whereas <i>Going After Cacciato</i> played with reality, <i>The Things They Carried</i> plays with truth. The narrator of most of these stories is "Tim"; yet O'Brien freely admits that many of the events he chronicles in this collection never really happened. He never killed a man as "Tim" does in "The Man I Killed," and unlike Tim in "Ambush," he has no daughter named Kathleen. But just because a thing never happened doesn't make it any less true. In "On the Rainy River," the character Tim O'Brien responds to his draft notice by driving north, to the Canadian border where he spends six days in a deserted lodge in the company of an old man named Elroy while he wrestles with the choice between dodging the draft or going to war. The real Tim O'Brien never drove north, never found himself in a fishing boat 20 yards off the Canadian shore with a decision to make. The real Tim O'Brien quietly boarded the bus to Sioux Falls and was inducted into the United States Army. But the truth of "On the Rainy River" lies not in facts but in the genuineness of the experience it depicts: both Tims went to a war they didn't believe in; both considered themselves cowards for doing so. Every story in <i>The Things They Carried</i> speaks another truth that Tim O'Brien learned in Vietnam; it is this blurred line between truth and reality, fact and fiction, that makes his book unforgettable. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Houghton Mifflin hardcover 1990/Previous ISBN 978-0-395-51598-3</p><h2>Mary, Bloody Mary</h2><p>Blood is thicker than water -- unless the King decrees othewise. A compelling first-person narration of childhood, as told by Henry VIII&#39;s daughter, Mary Tudor. History remembers her only as &#34;Bloody Mary&#34; because of the brutality of her reign, but this compelling recreation of her childhood brings alive the contradictions and conflicts and true danger of being the daughter of a &#39;divorced&#39; queen as her father falls under the spell of the &#34;witch&#34; Anne Boleyn and why such an apparently privileged little girl could grow up to be such a monster. Published by Harcourt Brace in USA 1999, it has been widely reviewed and accalimed; was an ALA Notable Book, and among the ALA 10 Notable Books of that year.</p><p>Teen fans of the movie <i>Elizabeth</i> will be fascinated with the pomp and sinister intrigue of <i>Mary, Bloody Mary</i>, an engrossing story about the teen years of Mary Tudor, half sister to Queen Elizabeth and daughter to Henry VIII. As a baby, Mary was adored by her father, who carried her around on his shoulder and displayed her for the court to admire. But as his marriage with her mother, Catherine of Aragon, waned for lack of a male heir, Henry began an affair with the beautiful Anne Boleyn. Mary was convinced that Anne was a witch. Didn't everyone know she had a sixth finger? And wasn't it Anne who persuaded Henry to declare his first marriage invalid (rendering Mary a bastard)? As the king grows ever colder, Mary is banished to a distant house, forbidden from seeing her mother, left to wear rags, and finally--at Anne's bidding--summoned back to court to be a servant to her baby half sister Elizabeth. Once there, Mary lives in constant dread that she will be poisoned or sent to the executioner's block in one of her father's rages. By the time Anne Boleyn herself is beheaded, Henry's first daughter has become the bitter and angry woman who was to be known as Bloody Queen Mary for her savage religious genocide. Carolyn Meyer, long acclaimed for her teen fiction (<i>Drummers of Jericho</i>), accurately captures the glitter and grandeur as well as the brutality of this fascinating period in history.

Alongside this lifestyle, depression rates have skyrocketed: approximately 1 in 4 Americans will suffer from major depression at some point in their lives. Where have we gone wrong? Dr. Stephen Ilardi sheds light on our current predicament and reminds us: <i>our bodies were never designed for the sleep-deprived, poorly nourished, frenzied pace of twenty-first century life.</i> In fact, our genes have changed very little since the days of our hunter-gatherer ancestors and are still building, in effect, Stone Age bodies. Herein lies the key to breaking the cycle of depression.<br><br>Inspired by the extraordinary resilience of aboriginal groups like the Kaluli of Papua New Guinea (who rarely suffer from depression), Dr. Ilardi prescribes an easy-to-follow, clinically proven program that harks back to what our bodies were originally made for-and need. Here you can find the road back to lasting health by integrating the following 6 elements into your life: an omega-3 rich diet; exercise; plenty of natural sunlight; ample sleep; social connections; and participation in meaningful tasks that leave little time for negative thoughts-all things that our ancestors had in abundance.<br><br>Already, <i>The Depression Cure</i> program has delivered dramatic results, helping even those who have failed to respond to traditional medications. Interweaving the stories of many who have fought-and won-the battle against this debilitating illness, this groundbreaking book can illuminate the path to lifting the fog once and for all for you or a loved one.<br><br></p><p><b>Stephen S. Ilardi, PhD</b>, is associate professor of clinical psychology at the University of Kansas and the author of over 40 professional articles on mental illness. Through his active clinical practice, Dr. Ilardi has treated several hundred depressed patients. He lives with his family in Lawrence, Kansas.<b>Bookviews.com</b><br> &#x201c;[Ilardi&#x2019;s] program helps patients reclaim six ancient lifestyle elements that can improve or eradicate depression. These include a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the critical building blocks for brain structure and function; enjoyable activities that keep us from dwelling on negative thoughts; exercise that stimulates important brain chemicals; sufficient sunlight exposure to keep the body&#x2019;s clock in sync; social support to avoid isolation; and healthy sleep habits that allow the brain and body to recover.

If you are one of the more than six billion people alive today who have not, a little explanation is in order. They are Three Guys From MiamiTM who share a passion for good food, good conversation, and a great party. Are you are new to Cuban cuisine? If so, then you are about to enter an exciting world of flavor. Cuban cooking combines the tastes of Spain with the tropical flavors of the Caribbean. Throw in some New World spices and ingredients and a strong African influence and you have the essence of Cuban cookery. These recipes also reflect ingredients and methods that were refined by Cuban exiles after they came to the United States. Here they found an abundance of foods that were either very scarce or completely unavailable in Castro&#39;s Cuba. Fish and seafood are two examples of foods that were only rarely enjoyed in Cuba after 1959. It was also impossible to get real olive oil-an ingredient that gives so many Cuban dishes a distinctive Latin flavor. Exile in the U.S. also exposed Cubans to ingredients they never saw in Havana. Salmon is very popular with Miami Cubans, for example, but unheard of in Cuba. Wherever possible the Three Guys have made these dishes simple to prepare. You don&#39;t need to be a professional chef to create any of the recipes in this book. Best of all, you don&#39;t need to be Cuban to cook and enjoy them. If a Swedish guy from Minnesota can cook Cuban food (and he does it very well), you can too! They have madge several appearances on the Food Network. Glenn Lindgren first came to Miami in 1984 and fell in love with the city, the people, and the Cuban culture. A freelance writer by profession, Glenn documents the antics of the Three Guys From Miami in books and on the Internet. When not in Miami, Glenn and his wife live in Minnesota with their son and two daughters. Raul Musibay, born in Cayo la Rosa, near Bauta, in the province of Havana, spent one winter in New Jersey but has been a full-time Miami resident ever since. He is the manager of the Red Bird Amoco station there. He and his wife have two married children. Jorge Castillo was born and raised in Cayo la Rosa, Havana. He came to the United States via the Mariel Boatlift in 1980, then left Miami after three months to live in Iowa, where he became a respiratory therapist. Now the regional sales manager for a major medical products company, he makes his home in Miami&#39;s West Dade with his wife and two daughters.</p><p>Excerpted from Three Guys from Miami Cook Cuban by Glenn M. Lindgren, Raul Musibay, Jorge Castillo. Copyright � 2004. Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. The Mojito <p>Ra�l: The mojito is a classic drink in Cuba. It got its origin in the cane fields, where workers were provided with large barrels of sugarcane juice, what we call guarapo, to drink after a hot day cutting sugarcane. </p><p>Glenn: On Saturday nights, the plantation owners would spike the guarapo with a little aguardiente, a crude form of rum; thus began a long tradition of Saturday night Cuban parties! </p><p>Jorge: As time went on, the workers began adding yerba buena, a type of mint leaf, to the barrel for flavor. Today the best mojitos are sill made with this leaf. If you have a Latin market in your neighborhood, you might be able to find some. It has to be fresh! </p><p>Glenn: If not, use spearmint or peppermint&#x2014;again fresh from the garden. They are the best substitutes. </p><p>Jorge: We&#x2019;ve noticed lately that some trendy restaurants and bars have been serving a very dry mojito. The classic mojito should be very sweet! </p><p>Ingredients: </p><p>3 teaspoons sugar Juice of 1/2 lime </p><p>Fresh yerba buena (or mint) leaves 1 ounce white rum Ice cubes Soda water </p><p>Put sugar and lime juice in a glass. Crush a few fresh mint leaves into the sugar and lime juice. Add rum and ice cubes. Fill with soda water and serve with a sprig of mint. Serves 1 </p><p>Ensalada de Aguacate y Pi�a &#x2014; Avocado and Pineapple Salad </p><p>Glenn: This great Cuban salad blends the sweetness of pineapple with the sour flavor of oil and vinegar. </p><p>Ra�l: We know it sounds strange, but it tastes great! </p><p>Jorge: Make sure to use a good Spanish olive oil. </p><p>Glenn: For salads, an extra virgin olive oil with its lighter taste is usually the best choice. </p><p>Jorge: Don&#x2019;t forget to salt and pepper the dressing to taste. Many people don&#x2019;t think that salad needs salt, but this one truly does. </p><p>Ingredients: </p><p>1/3 cup olive oil 1/3 cup vinegar 1/3 cup orange juice 1/3 cup sugar Salt and pepper to taste </p><p>1 head iceberg lettuce, shredded 2 cups of fresh ripe pineapple chunks 1 medium sweet red onion, sliced thin 1 large Florida avocado, peeled and sliced Fresh limes </p><p>Combine olive oil, vinegar, orange juice, and sugar in a blender until smooth. Add salt and pepper to this mixture to taste. Lightly toss the lettuce, pineapple, and red onion together. Pour on the oil and vinegar mixture until everything is well coated. Adjust the amount used to your own preference, more or less. </p><p>Garnish individual salads with several avocado slices lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and a squeeze of lime juice. Serves 6 to 8. </p><p>The American Influence on Cuban Food </p><p>The American influence on food has been evident throughout Cuba&#x2019;s history, with the peak in the 1950s. American cheese (queso Americano), American white bread (pan molde), the hamburger, peanuts roasted in the shell, Vienna sausages, and Spam are just a few of the American food items that were brought to Cuba. </p><p>Jorge fondly remembers going to the two-story Woolworth&#x2019;s store in Havana with his sister, where he would enjoy a delicious grilled cheese sandwich made with sliced white bread and American cheese. Cubans may have gotten their inspiration from the United States, but they soon made several changes and improvements to give even these traditional American foods a Latin flavor!</p>Table of Contents Introduction Drinks Cafe Cubano-Cuban Coffee Cuba Libre-Rum and Coke Ponche Habana Para Los Ninos-Havana Punch for Kids Mojito-Rum Drink Papa Hemingway-Daiquiri Appetizers Arepas-Cornmeal Pancakes Bollos Croquetas de Jamon-Ham Croquettes Croquetas de Papas y Jamon-Potato and Ham Croquettes Empanadas-Cuban Pastries Empanadas de Pollo-Chicken Empanadas Empanadas de Pollo y Queso-Chicken and Cheese Empanadas Empanadas de Camarones-Shrimp Empanadas Empanadas de Carne Asada-Beef Empanadas Empanadas de Cangrejo-Crab Empanadas Empanadas de JamUn or Chorizo-Ham or Sausage Empanadas Empanadas de Carne y Cebolla-Beef and Onion Empanadas Focaccia Cubana-Cuban Focaccia Frituras de Malanga-Malanga Fritters Mariquitas-Chips Mariquitas Salsa-Sauce for Chips Papa Rellena-Fried Stuffed Potatoes Tamales de Carne de Cerdo-Pork Tamales Salads Ensalada Cubana Tropica-Typical Cuban Salad Ensalada de Aguacate y Pina-Avocado and Pineapple Salad Ensalada de Garbanzos-Cuban Garbanzo Bean Salad Ensalada de Pollo-Chicken Salad Soups Ajiaco Criollo-Country-Style Stew Caldo Gallego-White Bean Soup Fabada Asturiana-Hearty Spanish Bean Soup Gazpacho de Glenn y Jorge-Glenn and Jorge&#39;s Cuban Gazpacho Guisado de Chorizo y Papas-Chorizo and Potato Stew Potaje de Frijoles Colorados-Red Bean Potage Sopa de Ajo-Garlic Soup Sopa de Chicharos-Cuban Split Pea Soup Sopa de Platanos-Plaintain Soup Sopa de Pollo-Chicken Soup Sandwiches Elena Ruz-Cuban Turkey Sandwich Frita Cubana-Cuban Hamburger Pan con Lechon-Roast Pork Sandwich Sandwich Cubano-Cuban Sandwich Medianoche-Midnight Sandwich Main Dishes: Eggs Huevos a la Flamenco-Flamenco-Style Eggs Huevos Habaneros-Havana-Style Eggs Pastel de Chorizo-Cuban Chorizo Pie Main Dishes: Meat AjIes Rellenos-Stuffed Green Peppers AlbUndigas-Cuban Meatballs Arroz con Pollo-Chicken with Rice Bistec Empanizado-Cuban Breaded Steak Bistec de Palomilla-Palomilla Steak Boliche-Cuban Pot Roast Carne Guisado-Cuban Beef Stew Churrasco Estilo Cubano-Cuban-Style Skirt Steak Cordero en Salsa de Vino Rojo-Lamb Shanks in Red Wine Sauce LechUn Asado-Roast Pork Masitas de Puerco Fritas-Fried Pork Chunks Picadillo-Cuban-Style Hash Picadillo con Papas-Picadillo with Potatoes Pollo Asado al Ajillo-Garlic Roasted Chicken Pollo Agridulce-Sweet and Spicy Chicken Pollo de Guayaba Dulce-Sweet Guava Chicken Rabo Encendido-Oxtail Stew Ropa Vieja-Shredded Beef Tasajo-Dried Beef Vaca Frita-Fried Beef Main Dishes: Seafood Camarones y Arroz Amarillo-Shrimp and Yellow Rice Bacalao a la Cerito-Baked Codfish Enchilado de Mariscos-Seafood Creole Paella Cubana-Three Guys Cuban-Style Paella Pargo Entero Frito con Salsa de Mango-Snapper with Mango Salsa Pescado de Habana-Grilled Fish Havana-Style Picadillo de Pescado-Cuban Fish Hash Salmon de Raul a la Parilla-Raul&#39;s Salmon Grilled in Foil Side Dishes Arroz Imperial-Imperial Rice Calabaza a la Parilla-Calabaza on the Grill Chimichurri-Sauce for Meat El ltimo Arroz Blanco-The Ultimate White Rice Frijoles Negros-Black Beans Fuf-Mashed Plantains L.A.

Covering a range of art movements, filmmakers such as Godard and Bresson, and thinkers such as Foucault, Deleuze, Adorno, Barthes, Lyotard and Greenberg, Ranci�re shows that contemporary theorists of the image are suffering from religious tendencies.<br><br>He argues that there is a stark political choice in art: it can either reinforce a radical democracy, or create a new reactionary mysticism. For Ranci�re there is never a pure art: the aesthetic revolution must always embrace egalitarian ideals.</p><p><b>Jacques Ranci�re</b> is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris-VIII.

Carter examines race as an issue in presidential politics. Drawing on his broad knowledge of recent political history, he traces the "counterrevolutionary" response to the civil rights movement since Wallace's emergence on the national scene in 1963, and detects a gradual intersection of racial and economic conservatism in the coalition that re-shaped American politics from the 1970s through the mid-1990s. Concise yet replete with insight, wit, and often-amusing, always-telling anecdotes, this timely, timeless book is an uncommon blend of important and enjoyable reading.</p></p><p>Dan T. Carter is Educational Foundation Professor of History Emeritus at the University of South Carolina and former president of the Southern Historical Association. He is the author of Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South, winner of the Bancroft Prize, the Anisfield-Wolf Award, and the Lillian Smith Award; The Politics of Rage: George Wallace, the Origins of the New Conservatism, and the Transformation of American Politics; and When the War Was Over: The Failure of Self-Reconstruction in the South, winner of the Avery O. Craven Award of the Organization of American Historians. He won an Emmy Award for his role as chief historical adviser for the documentary George Wallace: &#34;Setting the Woods on Fire,&#34; which is based on his book The Politics of Rage; and he was a primary adviser on the documentary film Scottsboro: An American Tragedy which was nominated for Oscar and Emmy awards.In his 1995 biography of Wallace, The Politics of Rage, LSU professor Carter called the former Alabama governor, "the most influential loser in twentieth century American politics." Wallace saw in America's white suburbs a racism that, while perhaps not as outspoken as that in the South, could still be exploited. The three lectures that form the bulk of this book were given in 1991 when Carter was working on The Politics of Rage, so some of the argument will sound familiar. But it is short and focused, so readers who weren't willing to devote over 500 pages to Wallace can discover his lasting effect on American politics. If Wallace took the issue of race to the rest of the nation, Nixon embedded it in a set of social issues and attitudes: "The trick lay in sympathizing with and appealing to the fears of angry whites without appearing to become an extremist and driving away moderates-or, as Ehrlichman described the process, to present a position on crime, education, or public housing in such a way that a voter could 'avoid admitting to himself that he was attracted by a racist appeal.'" In the 1980s, Republicans were able to embed encoded racial issues (quotas and welfare dependency) in their anti-government campaigning. While Carter has supplemented his original lectures with another chapter that includes the Republican victories of 1994, it addresses Newt Gingrich without mentioning one man who has done some cribbing from the Republican playbook-Bill Clinton. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Invasion #1: First Strike (Star Trek, Book 79)</h2><p>Receiving a surprising cry for help from the Klingon Empire, Captain Kirk learns that an alien civilization once owned the section of space belonging to the Klingons, Romulans, and Federation, and has come back to reclaim it.

He was keen-minded and quick and soon learned the ways of the scriptorium, of the illuminated manuscripts.

But first, the monastery&#x2019;s father tells him, he must learn how to capture mice.<br><br>Prolific author W.

He isthe author of twenty-six books for readers young and old. Along with writingfor various aged readers, Mr. Nikola-Lisa writes in a variety of genresincluding historical fiction, creative nonfiction, juvenile and middle gradefiction, and memoir. Some of his titles include <i>Bein' With You This Way</i>, <i>ShakeDem Halloween Bones</i>, <i>How We Are Smart</i>,and <i>The Men Who Made the Yankees</i>. Anaccomplished storyteller and musician, Mr. Nikola-Lisa enjoys sharing hiswriting experiences whenever possible.For more information, please visit his website at nikolabooks.com.Simon, a young orphan in the Middle Ages, is an apprentice in a monastery's scriptorium, where books are written. He learns to prepare parchment, grind pigments, and write, but he dreams of illustrating illuminated manuscripts. The monastery's Father instructs Simon to practice by capturing mice. "Study them, get to know them . . and use your imagination." Simon begins by setting traps, but he eventually understands the figurative use of language, and his fanciful drawings of mice earn him a job in the scriptorium at last. Younger children may struggle with the play on the word <i>capture</i> and the messages about what an artist does. Many kids, though, will be drawn in by the appealing story of a child's empowerment and the glimpse of the medieval world. Christensen extends the story with strong, clear scenes, bordered by botanical patterns and executed in ink and egg-tempura pigments, just like the monks used. A final word about the time period closes this solid title, which is sure to find a place in the classroom. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Cruising the same stretch of blacktop is Carmen Greer. But the lift comes with a hitch. She's got a wild story to tell--about her husband, her family secrets, and a hometown that's pure Gothic.</p></p><p>Jack Reacher is Spenser before Robert Parker domesticated his Boston PI--in fact, Reacher's even tougher than Hawk. He can inhale and exhale a few times and pump up his muscles so they make a bad character think twice about tangling with him. And he's spent enough time on the right side of the law to know how to operate in the gray zone if that's what it takes to save the fair maiden, punish the bad guys, and right any other wrongs he happens to encounter in the course of his wanderings. <i>Echo Burning</i> is vintage Lee Child, a smartly paced, intricately plotted, and masterfully characterized thriller starring Reacher, the ex-military cop who's so concerned about commitment to anything--a woman, possessions, a permanent address--that he only owns the clothes on his back. But he's the kind of justice-seeking guy you'd want on your side, especially if you were an abused wife trapped in a marriage you can't get out of until, and unless, somebody bumps off your old man. <p> Reacher's sympathetic, but he's not crazy. Nonetheless, he allows himself to be drawn into beautiful Carmen Greer's orbit, which ought to teach a guy not to hitchhike. Agreeing to protect her from the husband who's about to be released from jail and, according to Carmen, who's about to pay her back for tipping off the authorities to the tax fraud that landed him in prison, Reacher moves into the bunkhouse of the Echo, Texas, ranch that's owned by the bigoted, bitter, but powerful Greer family, which despises Carmen because she's Mexican and tolerates her only because she's Sloop Greer's wife and the mother of his child. The expected bloodshed ensues, but it's Sloop, not Carmen, who ends up with a bullet in his head. Reacher's convinced that Carmen acted in self-defense, even after other evidence comes to light that suggests there's more--and less--to her unhappy tale than even her own lawyer believes. This is the best Jack Reacher yet, smart, stylish, and convincing.

That edition has been out for print for more than a decade. In this Silver Anniversary Benchmark Publications&#39; edition, author and artist Malcolm Furlow again shows you how to build your own version of the HOn3 San Juan Central. A new chapter tells what has happened to the railroad and its builder in the past 25 years. &#34;THIS BOOK describes how its author, Malcolm Furlow, built the San Juan Central, an HOn3 model railroad. Malcolm described building this layout in a nine-part series of articles in MODEL RAILROADER magazine (November 1983 to August 1984). These articles were re-published by Kalmbach Books in 1984 - as the softbound HO Narrow Gauge Railroad You Can Build. The book went through three printings by Kalmbach over the next seven years. &#34;Now, 25 years after the first printing, this Silver Anniversary Edition has been produced by Benchmark Publications, Ltd., publishers of the NARROW GAUGE AND SHORT LINE GAZETTE magazine. &#34;While the text, drawings, and photos of the original book have been faithfully reproduced, the front and back covers are new, as is this introduction, and a chapter about the many activities of Malcolm after he built the San Juan Central - and what happened to it. &#34;Benchmark Publications is proud to make Malcolm&#39;s book available again, and would like to thank Kalmbach for generously allowing us reprint it. We also want to thank Bob Hayden for organizing this Silver Anniversary Edition.

In describing this autobiography she said &#39;My earnest wish is to paint in true colors the goodness of God to me, and the depth of my own ingratitude.&#39; Her amazing recognition of God&#39;s grace, coupled with an acute awareness of her own sinfulness, forms the heart of this story.&#34; (From Back Cover)</p><p>Jeanne Marie Bouvier de La Motte was born near Paris in 1648. She was a sickly child who married a wealthy neighbor (22 years her senior) when she was 16 years of age. At 28 she was a widow with three small children. At age 47 she was imprisoned because her writings about God and prayer ran contrary to the established church of the time. She lost her freedom for 7 years during which time she continued to write about the God she loved.</p><h2>The Barefoot Princess (Lost Princesses, Book 2)</h2><p><blockquote><p><em>Once upon a time...in a kingdom high in the Pyrenees, three young princesses were forced to flee the chaos in their land -- vanishing without a trace and lost to their people...until the day a courageous prince can bring each princess home.</em></p></blockquote><p>Life in exile has taught the passionate Princess Amy to hate injustice, and on the enchanting English isle of Summerwind, she finds injustice personified in the powerful and wickedly handsome Jermyn Edmondson, marquess of Northcliff. Since he has stolen the islanders' livelihood, Amy decides to steal <em>him</em>. She kidnaps the arrogant nobleman, chains him with his own manacles, and holds him for ransom.</p><p>It's a simple plan, destined to succeed. Surely Jermyn's uncle will pay his ransom. Alas, his uncle would be delighted if someone killed his nephew and left him to inherit the title and fortune.

Her coterie of New York artists and grad students, junkies and collectors dwells in walk-ups and covets lofts. The occasional socialite wafts through, characterized tersely by statements of fact; for example, "Millie owned her own co-op." But, for the most part, these are the also-rans of Manhattan life, literally looking for a toehold in the city. The main character who emerges is shabby Eleanor, an appealing heroine who appears in several linked stories. A jewelry maker, she lives with an artist named Stash and a treasure-trove of insecurities. Much is made of the squalor of their apartment. In Eleanor, Janowitz finds a channel for her vulnerability--a nice counterpoint to her affectless prose, which attempts and occasionally achieves a deadpan humor.<p> Intertwined with the Eleanor stories are the unreliable first-person narratives of Marley Mantello. Marley, too, has serious real estate issues: "My apartment, the sublet from which I was being evicted, looked just as terrible as when I had gone out earlier--worse, even, for there was a foul reek of something fecund and feline, like the stench of old lion spoor upon the veldt."</p><p> The rest of the stories are brief thumbnails, which Janowitz calls "modern saints" and "case histories." Stabbing at experimentalism, they showcase her shortcomings--the lazy satire, the easy laugh. This author's prose seemed of-the-moment when it came out, and time has not been altogether kind. "I was startled to find him so far uptown, knowing how he usually refused to travel above Fourteenth Street, claiming it led to mental decay," says the narrator of "In and Out of the Cat Bag." This kind of observation may have seemed edgy in 1985, but has little staying power. At its best, <i>Slaves</i> effervesces a bittersweet nostalgia for a time when artists could still afford to live in Manhattan. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Meet the denizens of New York City: artists, prostitutes, saints, and seers. All are aspiring toward either fame or oblivion, and hoping for love and acceptance. Instead they find high rents, faithless partners, and dead-end careers. But between the disappointments come snatches of self-awareness, and a strange beauty in their encounters with one another.</p><h2>Handwriting Analysis: The Science of Determining Personality by Graphoanalysis</h2><p>the science of determining personality by handwriting</p><p></p><h2>Thunder in the Mountains: The Life and Times of Madera Sugar Pine</h2><p>History of the Madera Sugar pine Railroad and the Sugar Pine Railroad.

Everyone has heard tales of men who have gone there and never come back. Yet one day young Pat Conroy and his friend Danny MacDonagh head off anyway, telling their parents that they are fishing for eels. On the island they find no ghosts but many mysteries, including a beautiful&#x2014;and tame&#x2014;black colt. But when they return home, with the colt in tow, they find themselves launched into a world of trouble. Before their adventure is over, the boys must brave rough seas and the murderous duplicity of a conniving horse trader, with only the advice of Pat's frail grandmother and their own good sense to guide them.<br><br>A loving, clear-eyed portrait of rural Irish life, <i>The Island of Horses</i> is fraught with suspense and peopled with unforgettable individuals.</p><p><b>Eil�s Dillon</b> (1920-1994) wrote more than thirty books for young people, as well as fiction for adults, including the best-selling historical novel <i>Across the Bitter Sea</i>, about the struggle for Irish independence in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

I just now--literally--got back from the WorldCon in Reno. It was fun--and I was also able to personally thank Steve Stirling for the nice blurb he gave my first book. Of course, I am also humbly honored by the very nice blurb you just gave me! If we're not careful, people might begin to suspect we are friends! Of course my meager, good opinion of everything you have written is a matter of record--and espoused at every opportunity! </p> <p><strong>David Weber:</strong> Friends! <i>Friends!?</i> How could anyone possibly suspect such a thing?! But I digress. You're certainly welcome to the cover blurb, since it's only accurate. I mean, us being friends and all I probably would have lied for you if I'd needed to, but what the heck? It's always nicer when you can say nice things because they're accurate. Helps add to your reputation for infallibility, you know. </p> <p>Anyway, I've got <i>How Firm a Foundation</i>, which is, what--Safehold #4?--coming out in September. You've got one coming out next month, too, as I recall. So you want to tell me what you're going to do to Walker's crew and their friends this time? </p> <p><strong>Taylor Anderson: </strong> I am SOOOOO stoked to read <i>How Firm a Foundation</i>. Most of my reading lately has been old tech manuals, and I need some David Weber! I love how your "Merlin" manages to prod the Safehold tech development along. Artificial being or not, it has to be frustrating to have all that information--that will save lives--running around in his/her head and have to be so careful about revealing it in a logical progression. I'm still improving the "tech" in <i>Firestorm: Destroyermen</i>--which comes out October 4th--but the contrast in how it is applied is fun to compare to the Safehold series. </p> <p> Your "Merlin" knows...everything, but has to hold back while everyone else accepts what is possible, whereas my Destroyermen know what is possible, but don't necessarily know how, or how best to achieve it. Different frustrations. Your guys have to be a lot more careful! Of course the Grik are still there, with their mad Japanese advisor--but the Grik are starting to "get wise" almost in spite of Kurokawa. He gives them technology, but retains his own agenda. Battle will rage on the land, sea, and in the air! </p> <p><strong>David Weber:</strong> Well, as you know, I "snippet" excerpts of the books on my website, so we're several thousand words into <i>How Firm a Foundation</i>, already. That makes things...interesting from my perspective, since the fans can't wait to start suggesting what my characters should be "inventing" next. I haven't even got steam engines past the proscriptions of the Inquisition yet, and some of these guys seem to think I should already be designing <i>King Edward VII</i>-class, pre-dreadnought battleships! I did just give the Charisians breech-loading caplocks, though. That's going to make life interesting for the other side. And Merlin is about to find out (sort of) what I stashed--I'm sorry, what the <i>Archangel Langhorne</i> stashed--under the Temple. It is a bit darker book, though, since the Church gets in a few licks of its own this time around. Your guys have had that experience, too, I think, haven't they? </p> <p> One thing I'm pondering about is introducing a better propellant than black powder. I'd have to be really careful about that, dealing with the anti-technology proscriptions, but back when Safehold was first settled, the Church did set up the rote preparation and production of fertilizers on a relatively large-scale. It's occurred to me that if I want to introduce nitrocellulose, I might have a platform for that in the fertilizer industry. Or perhaps I should say in the fertilizer pre-industry, since we're not exactly talking about current day DuPont levels of production. What do you think? Practical or would I be stretching things too far? </p> <p><strong>Taylor Anderson: </strong> I haven't done "snippets," but I still get a lot of suggestions and speculation on my web site and through direct contacts. I think it's fun and exciting that so many people are thinking about our books. Some of the suggestions are a little strange--okay, sometimes all I can do is just stare--but <i>Destroyermen</i> is a kind of strange story! The contrast between "They couldn't really do that," and "Why don't they have atomic weapons yet?" from one contact to the next can be amusing though. Things take time, particularly when your characters have to find the things to build the things to build the things they need.</p> <p> If you're asking my opinion on propellants, I'd have to suggest sticking with black powder for a while. Your caplock breechloaders will be easy to convert, certainly. I'm converting rifle-muskets to a type of "Allin" breechloader myself. But you can actually get better performance out of black powder in such weapons since they weren't designed (or alloyed and treated) for the higher pressures "smokeless" produces. You'd have to make some major leaps in metallurgy to support jacketed bullets as well, and without them, you're stuck with black powder velocities anyway. Besides, your battles are so much more artistic with plenty of fire and smoke!</p> <p> Of course, then comes logistics! Ha! As you always show so well, getting "new" stuff to the pointy end--and supplying it--is the greatest challenge of all...but then that's pretty fun to write and read about too, isn't it? Wow. I can't wait to be taunted with what you <i>Langhorne</i> stashed! People who know we are friends ask me all the time what "it" is and don't really believe me when I tell them "I don't know!" If I did, I wouldn't rat--and I don't WANT to know until it unfolds on the pages in front of me! </p> <p><strong>David Weber:</strong> I'm inclined to stick with black powder for small arms for quite a while, for a lot of reasons, including the ones you've mentioned. I'm not too sure about how major a jump I'd have to make to support jacketed bullets--the Safehold-ian tech structure doesn't match up perfectly with any particular, in Earth's history, thanks to all of the "technologies without the science" tucked away in the <i>Holy Writ</i>. That means it wouldn't be beyond the reach of allowable technologies (and Safehold-current techniques) to form copper jackets and then compress the lead into them. I'm inclined to agree with you about the conversion process, and I'm also inclined to think that converting the smokeless powders would also require a drop in caliber, if I want to take advantage of the higher velocities flatter trajectories without beating my poor riflemen to death! </p> <p> I was looking at improved propellants more from the perspective of naval gunnery, field artillery, and shell-fillers (I know, I know--not a "propellant". So sue me!) and that sort of thing. Can't have really long-range gunnery without predictable propellant burn times, and I don't think I can get that kind of quality control out of black powder. At the same time, I have to be thinking in terms of reasonably attainable technologies. And you'd better believe I plan on putting my head together with yours when I actually start converting to cartridges and repeaters! </p> <p> Of course, my life is even more interesting in the next couple of months than yours is, because I [he said, blushing modestly and looking down at his toes] have a new book coming out in October, as well! I finally got around to writing that young adult novel I've wanted to write for so long for Baen's publishing, <i>A Beautiful Friendship</i>, next month. Trust me; it's a very different change of pace from the Safehold books! </p> <p><strong>Taylor Anderson:</strong> Oh I know about <i>A Beautiful Friendship</i>, you prolific devil. I've already pre-ordered it too. You're right of course. No real reason why better steels would be proscribed I guess. That's what I meant about jacketed bullets, by the way. Not the bullets themselves, but the barrels that will have to survive them--especially if you increase your rate of fire dramatically! Hehe. Once you eliminate that gas-gushing vent in a muzzle-loader, black powder is amazingly consistent in cartridges--but you still need a whopping heavy (and abusive) bullet to carry your energy along. Flat shooters they ain't. </p> <p> It's no secret that "my" Destroyermen have been working on guncotton and other things. They have the recipe--from that same, valuable little manual we both have!--but the recipe needs a little adjustment when you're not sure what to use for cotton, for example! </p><p> </p><p>Experimentation can be exciting, and a lot of the fun is letting the characters come up with their own angles. Like I've said, as capable as my Destroyermen are, there are a lot of things they don't know how to do, and they often come up with weird, "wrong," but adequate procedures. Also, with their fascination for gizmos, the Lemurians are beginning to come up with some slap your forehead notions and applications that might never have occurred to humans--which begs the question: why did they occur to me? </p> <p> I'm all for juicing up naval artillery--or any artillery at all, as you know--but at sea, particularly, greater range is wasted without some advanced means of fire control. Even rifling won't help much. It's all in the timing, if you know what I mean. Oh, I've got the perfect repeater for you! I can't--actually <i>won't</i> use it--for the same reason I won't use another conversion we discussed, and I would love to see you use (hint). They just wouldn't make sense for my guys and their different starting point. For YOU however...they might even pass the proscriptions!</p> <p><strong>David Weber:</strong> Oh, yeah. I just finished, like a week or so ago, posting somewhere around a 5,000-word dissertation on the requirements for long-range naval gunnery on the Safehold forum on my website, because some of my readers were wondering how soon the Imperial Charisian Navy is going to go to long-range gunnery, by which some of them seemed to be thinking 20,000 or 30,000 yards. I had to explain that without centralized fire control to make sure all guns fired at exactly the right moment and on the right bearing, without inclinometers to be sure they fired at the right point in the ship's roll, without the ability to predict target movement, without accurate range-finding, and--especially--without predictable and repeatable propellant burn times (not to mention monitoring board erosion, temperature, humidity, propellant temperature, etc.), accurate naval gunnery at anything much over 6,000 yards is going to be problematical at best. I think that sort of "taking things for granted" is part of the price we pay for living at the "user end" of a technological world in the first place, but it starts coming home to you when you do the kind of thing you and I are doing in our books which is trying to build a technological infrastructure from scratch and figuring out how the wheel was invented in the first place!</p> <p> Although, you know, thinking about it, what we're both doing in our different ways that's even more significant than the technology, I think, is looking at the values of the fictitious societies we've created. When you come down to it, technology is just tools -- it's what people do with those tools that distinguishes them from one another. Dark Age mentalities can do terrifying amounts of damage with modern technology. God knows we've seen enough of that in recent years, haven't we? I first came up with the concept for the Safehold books something like twenty years ago, and I've been mostly faithful to that original concept, but I can't pretend it hasn't been modified by things that have happened in the real world since. I actually make an effort to avoid having that happen, but I don't think any author can do that, really. After all, we live in the real world! But what my heroes are doing on Safehold and what your Destroyermen and their allies are doing on your alternate Earth is trying to push back the darkness, and I think that's the real reason a lot of their fans want to know what happens next in both universes. I know I sure do, at any rate!</p> <p><strong>Taylor Anderson:</strong> Ha! Few things could be more difficult to comprehend than all the variables that prevent accurate long range naval gunnery. Just figuring out all those variables is hard enough, and then compensating for them all presents an incredibly daunting challenge. The first "modern" computers, in all their complexity, were devoted to just that. Powered torpedoes add even more wild variables. I'll have to read your post to see how you managed to explain it all in a mere 5,000 words! I imagine that if anyone could do it, it would be you! </p> <p> Ultimately however, I couldn't agree with you more; the people <i>are</i> the story. The technology is fun to research, bend to our specific applications, write about, and kick around with each other, but our characters--defined by their character--drive the stories. The "Safehold" and the people who inhabit it, that Nimue Alban's...memories...awoke to was every bit as alien as the world Matt Reddy and his crew of USS Walker encounter in <i>Destroyermen</i>. Both worlds are as remote as they can possibly be to what they knew before, and full of unfamiliar threats and challenges. It is how they--and those around them--deal with their apparently insurmountable obstacles that form the "souls" of each story. Both have a vision for how best to protect and secure the people--and worlds--they have inherited, and both are determined to accomplish their task regardless of the cost, particularly to themselves. In this day and age, it may seem quaint to some that people might be so determined to "do the right thing, as they see it, when nobody is looking," in a sense. But I believe that quality is still admired, and is, I hope, the most resonant chord we have struck with both our tales. </p><b>David Weber</b> is a science fiction phenomenon.

Original.</p><p>Kathleen Fisher has been a journalist for more than 30 years, serving 9 years as the editor of the magazine of the American Horticultural Society.Well organized, easy to understand, and complete with appropriate cautions, this is a reasonable guide to using herbal remedies. Journalist Fisher (past editor of the magazine of the American Horticultural Society) first describes the dual role herbs can play, in that they can act both as preventive and healing medicines. She then explains how to prepare herbal formulas, from infusions, decoctions, and tinctures to capsules, compresses, ointments and salves. She then describes 32 medicinal herbs, including a description and illustration of each, what conditions it prevents or treats, what part(s) of the plant to use, and how to grow or find each. Some are quite familiar (aloe, fennel, echinacea), some more surprising (hops, catnip, feverfew). Fisher includes detailed instruction on harvesting and storing the plants. There follows treatment recommendations for 40 common ailments (e.g., acne, allergies, cuts, depression, liver problems, weight management), all with important provisos (for example: ``Safety first. Don't use Chinese angelica if you are pregnant It can cause uterine contractions''). Always proceed with caution, then: check with a medical practitioner and beware of interactions with medications. But all in all, a well-laid-out explanation of the possible benefits of herbs. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

One of their own members, Jean Grey, has gained power beyond all comprehension, and that power has corrupted her absolutely! Now they must decide if the life of the woman they cherish is worth the existence of the entire universe! Collects X-Men #129-137.</p><p>Believe the hype: the Dark Phoenix saga <i>is</i> one of the greatest comics stories ever. Conceived by writer Chris Claremont and penciller John Byrne (credited as co-plotters, and aided immeasurably by inker Terry Austin), the story begins in <i>The Uncanny X-Men</i> #129 when Professor X sends his team in search of two new mutants detected by Cerebro. The figures in question turn out to be Kitty Pride, who would eventually join the team as Sprite, and the flashy disco singer Dazzler, who would go on to star in her own book. Little do the X-Men know that they're walking into a trap set by the Hellfire Club, a group of supervillains that seem perfectly matched to counter our merry mutants. The insidious part of the plot, however, is how a mysterious man named Jason Wyngarde seems to have been Jean Grey's lover in another time, another era, and how that might give him control over her now. Jean Grey was, like Cyclops, an original member of the X-Men, and had the power of telepathy (a gentle power, like that of the Invisible Girl of the same era). When she was reborn as Phoenix in issue #108, however, she became power incarnate. Can it be controlled, or must the X-Men make a choice between the woman they love and the fate of the universe? It's all here in this nine-issue volume, plus Wolverine alone, Emma Frost, the return of original members Angel and Beast, and a showdown with Lilandra's Imperial Guard in one of comics' great milestone issues, <i>X-Men</i> #137.

And is America really in decline? Robert Kagan, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author and one of the country&#x2019;s most influential strategic thinkers, paints a vivid, alarming picture of what the world might look like if the United States were truly to let its influence wane.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although Kagan asserts that much of the current pessimism is misplaced, he warns that if America were indeed to commit &#x201c;preemptive superpower suicide,&#x201d; the world would see the return of war among rising nations as they jostle for power; the retreat of democracy around the world as Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s Russia and authoritarian China acquire more clout; and the weakening of the global free-market economy, which the United States created and has supported for more than sixty years. We&#x2019;ve seen this before&#x2014;in the breakdown of the Roman Empire and the collapse of the European order in World War I.<br> &nbsp;<br> Potent, incisive, and engaging, <i>The World America Made</i> is a reminder that the American world order is worth preserving, and America dare not decline.</p><p><b>Robert Kagan</b> is senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a columnist for <i>The Washington Post</i>. He is also the author of <i>The Return of History and the End of Dreams, Dangerous Nation, Of Paradise and Power, and A Twilight Struggle</i>.

He lives in Virginia with his wife and two children.<i>Excerpted from the Introduction</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> In the Frank Capra classic <i>It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Life, </i>George Bailey gets a chance to see what his world would have looked like had he never been born. It would be nice if we could do the same for the United States, to see what the world would have looked like had the United States not been the preeminent power shaping it for the past six decades, and to imagine what the world might look like if America were to decline, as so many nowadays predict.<br> &nbsp;<br> We take a lot for granted about the way the world looks today&#x2014;the widespread freedom, the unprecedented global prosperity (even despite the current economic crisis), and the absence of war among great powers. In 1941 there were only a dozen democracies in the world. Today there are over a hundred. For four centuries prior to 1950, global gross domestic product (GDP) rose by less than 1 percent a year. Since 1950 it has risen by an average of 4 percent a year, and billions of people have been lifted out of poverty. The first half of the twentieth century saw the two most destructive wars in the history of mankind, and in prior centuries war among great powers was almost constant. But for the past sixty years no great powers have gone to war with one another. Our era is best known for the war that never happened, between the United States and the Soviet Union.<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s plenty wrong with our world, of course, but from the perspective of thousands of years of recorded history, in which war, despotism, and poverty have been the norm, and peace, democracy, and prosperity the rare exceptions, our own era has been a golden age.<br> Some believe this is the inevitable result of human progress, a combination of advancing science and technology, an increasingly global economy, strengthening international institutions, evolving &#x201c;norms&#x201d; of international behavior, and the gradual but inevitable triumph of liberal democracy over other forms of government&#x2014;forces of change that transcend the actions of men and nations.<br> &nbsp;<br> But there is also another possibility. Perhaps the progress we enjoy was not an inevitable evolution of the human species but rather the product of a unique and perhaps fleeting set of circumstances: a particular arrangement of power in the international system that favors a certain worldview over others. Maybe if those conditions were to change, if power were to shift, then the characteristics of the world order would change, too. Perhaps democracy has spread to over a hundred nations since 1950 not simply because people yearn for democracy but because the most powerful nation in the world since 1950 has been a democracy. Perhaps the stunning global economic growth of the past six decades reflects an economic order shaped by the world&#x2019;s leading free-market economy. Perhaps the era of peace we have known has something to do with the enormous power wielded by one nation.<br> &nbsp;<br> History shows that world orders, including our own, are transient. They rise and fall. And the institutions they erected, the beliefs that guided them, and the &#x201c;norms&#x201d; that shaped the relations among nations within them&#x2014;they fall, too. Every international order in history has reflected the beliefs and interests of its strongest powers, and every international order has changed when power shifted to others with different beliefs and interests. On some occasions, the prevailing world order has simply collapsed into disorder. When the Roman Empire fell, the order it supported fell, too. Not just Roman government and law but an entire economic system stretching from northern Europe to North Africa was disrupted and would take centuries to rebuild. Culture, the arts, even progress in science and technology, were set back for centuries. People lost the recipe for cement.<br> &nbsp;<br> We saw a similar collapse of world order in our own time. The world we know today was erected amid the chaos and destruction following World War II and the collapse of the European-dominated order that had evolved over four centuries. That order was far from perfect: it produced many wars, an aggressive imperialism, and the widespread oppression of nonwhite races, but it also produced the conditions for an era of great human advances. By the late nineteenth century British control of the seas and the balance of great powers on the European continent together had provided the relative security and stability to allow a growth in prosperity, a modest if tenuous expansion of personal freedoms, and a world knit closer by the revolutions in commerce and communication we today call globalization. It kept peace among the great powers for almost four decades after the Napoleonic Wars, and for another four decades after the wars of German unification. It was so successful that many concluded at the dawn of the twentieth century that mankind had reached a summit of evolution and that major war and tyranny had become obsolete.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet with the outbreak of World War I, the age of settled peace and advancing liberalism&#x2014;of European civilization approaching its pinnacle&#x2014;collapsed into an age of hyper-nationalism, despotism, and economic calamity. The once promising spread of democracy and liberalism halted and then reversed course, leaving a handful of outnumbered and besieged democracies living nervously in the shadow of their newly fascist and totalitarian neighbors. Suddenly it was a world filled with predatory leaders sitting atop predatory powers. The collapse of the British and European orders in the twentieth century did not produce a new dark age&#x2014;though if Nazi Germany and imperial Japan had won the war, it might have&#x2014;but the cataclysm it did produce was, in its own way, no less devastating.<br> &nbsp;<br> Would the end of the present American order have less dire consequences? That is a question worth asking now, as so many contemplate the prospect of American decline. A surprising number of American intellectuals, politicians, and policy makers greet that prospect with equanimity. There is a general sense that the end of the era of American preeminence need not mean the end of the present liberal international order. The expectation, if not assumption, is that the good qualities of that order&#x2014;the democracy, the prosperity, the peace among great powers&#x2014;can transcend the decline of American power and influence. Even with diminished American power, the political scientist G. John Ikenberry writes, &#x201c;the underlying foundations of the liberal international order will survive and thrive.&#x201d;2 And there is an accompanying view that American decline is in any case already a fact of life, so whether it is a good thing or a bad thing, there is nothing we can do about it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Against this backdrop, it is worth exploring to what degree the present world order depends on American power and its unique qualities. What would it mean for the future if the international order were no longer shaped primarily by the United States and like-minded allied nations? Who or what would take America&#x2019;s place? And there is another set of questions, equally important: Is America really in decline? Or are Americans in danger of committing preemptive superpower suicide out of a misplaced fear of declining power?<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; <br><br> <b>Meet George Bailey: What is American About the American World Order? <br>&nbsp;</b><br> Why call it the &#x201c;American world order&#x201d; at all? The United States has certainly not shaped the international environment by itself. Many other peoples, as well as broad historical forces&#x2014;the evolution of science and technology, fluctuations in the availability of natural resources, long-term economic trends, population growth&#x2014;have also created today&#x2019;s world. Peoples on every continent have worked and suffered to lift themselves out of poverty and destruction and to make better lives for themselves and their children. The world is too big for any nation to shape by itself. Nevertheless, in any given historical period, the most powerful nations do put their own particular stamp on the international order, if only by virtue of their relative weight in the system. They establish many of the &#x201c;norms&#x201d; and rules of international behavior. They shape the nature of economic relations. They can even have influence in the realm of ideas and beliefs, including the way peoples worship their gods and the forms of government they consider legitimate. For many centuries the predominant power of China shaped the way millions of people throughout Asia thought, spoke, worshipped, painted, and carried on their commerce. In the nineteenth century, the great European powers imposed standards of international and domestic behavior not only for Europeans but for millions throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America. There has been an Egyptian order, a Roman order, a Greek order, an Islamic order, a Mogul order, an Ottoman order, and many others, and historians will undoubtedly view the period from the end of World War II until some yet to be determined moment as an American order.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet it has also been the American order in a more specific sense. It is not just that the United States has been the most influential power in the international system. The most important features of today&#x2019;s world&#x2014;the great spread of democracy, the prosperity, the prolonged great-power peace&#x2014;have depended directly and indirectly on power and influence exercised by the United States. No other power could have or would have influenced the world the way Americans have because no other nation shares, or has ever shared, their peculiar combination of qualities.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of the most important qualities are obvious. America&#x2019;s unique geographical circumstances, its capitalist economic system, its democratic form of government, and its enormous military power have together shaped a particular kind of international order that would have looked very different had another nation with different characteristics wielded a similar amount of influence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Less easy to grasp, but just as important to understanding the nature of the American world order, is the complex character of the American people. This is no simple paean to Americans&#x2019; superior virtues. Some portray Americans as farseeing builders of international institutions and structures of liberal order, as thoughtful &#x201c;operators&#x201d; and &#x201c;managers&#x201d; of vast global systems.3 But few Americans, and few non-Americans, would recognize this portrait. In most respects, Americans are like any other people, with a blend of selfishness and generosity. More than most, they have been a people of contradictory impulses and a most ambivalent view of what role, if any, they ought to play in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> They are a people rife with potent national myths that both inspire and mislead them. Start with the fact that one of the most powerful, influential, and expansive peoples in history still think of themselves as aloof, passive, self-contained, and generally inclined to minding their own business. In less than two centuries Americans transformed their nation from a sliver of settlement clinging to a coastline into a globe-girdling superpower with historically unparalleled power and influence. Yet to hear Americans tell it, they are the Greta Garbo of nations: they just want to be left alone. In their national mythology, the two-centuries-long subjugation of the North American continent, a region inhabited by Spaniards, French, and Russians, as well as by an entire race of indigenous peoples, was not conquest but the peaceful settlement of an empty frontier. Americans do not go &#x201c;abroad in search of monsters to destroy&#x201d; is the oft-quoted phrase of John Quincy Adams. If someone points out to them that they have, indeed, often done just that, then they portray themselves as the &#x201c;reluctant sheriff,&#x201d; their boots on the desk, reading the newspaper until some unsavory gang rides into town and forces them to pull their rifle off its rack, whether Japanese imperialists, Nazis, Soviet communists, or Islamic jihadis. &#x201c;The United States of America never goes to war because we want to,&#x201d; said one prominent politician a few years ago. &#x201c;We only go to war because we have to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But this self-perception, while sincere, bears no relation to reality. Since the late nineteenth century, when the United States became a world power, Americans have used force dozens of times, and rarely because they had no choice.5 They have sent troops to Mexico and Central America to depose troublesome leaders; they have fought the Spanish in Cuba and independence-minded guerrillas in the Philippines; they have fought anti-Western forces in China and communists in Vietnam and Korea, and have sent millions of troops to Europe, twice; they have fought dictators and jihadis in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. And they have done so for many reasons: to defend themselves from distant threats, to preserve economic interests, to protect peoples from slaughter, to resist aggression, to fight tyranny, to support democracy. Far more than any other democratic people in the world today, Americans see war as a legitimate, even essential, tool of foreign policy.6 Few modern nations, and no modern democracies, more revere their military heroes, both past and present. But every time they go to war, Americans promise themselves they&#x2019;ll never do it again.<br> &nbsp;<br> They are even ambivalent about the cause of democracy, with which they have always been so closely identified. Americans, even in Woodrow Wilson&#x2019;s day, never had a master plan for making the world over in their image. They have often ignored the dictators in their midst, allied with them, aided them, and done business with them. They are not missionaries. But neither have they been able to escape their democratic identity, their democratic conscience, and their conviction that their special cause is, as Ben Franklin said, the &#x201c;cause of all mankind.&#x201d; To be an American is to believe in and be committed to what Americans, and only Americans, like to call &#x201c;our way of life.&#x201d; Since they believe their founding principles are universal, they measure all other peoples against the same rigid standard. This highly ideological view of the world tells them that all nondemocratic governments are inherently illegitimate and therefore transient. Even John Quincy Adams, in the same speech in which he warned against seeking monsters to destroy, urged the peoples of Europe to follow the American example and mount revolutions against centuries-old monarchies: &#x201c;Go thou and do likewise!&#x201d;</p><h2>Closer Than Blood</h2><p>The first time was easy. No one ever suspected the victim had been murdered. The crime was long buried, but the dark passions guiding the killer&#39;s hand are still alive-a hunger for revenge that cannot be denied. Only one person can stop the killing. Only one person can identify the killer. Only one person knows the face of death is as close as the face in the mirror.... Like a Doberman with a rag doll, Gregg Olsen knows how to sink his teeth in and toss readers about. With Closer Than Blood, he delivers another of his riveting thrillers-an intelligent, heart-stopping read with three dimensional characters, wrenching plot twists and a terrifying exploration of the killing mind</p><p></p><h2>Weavers/Student Text/Level J</h2><p>Presents background information on cloth making in the colonies and describes the various techniques involved.</p><p></p><h2>30-Odd Boats</h2><p>Naval architect Phil Bolger lets his imagination soar once again in this, his fourth book of boat designs. The Bolger flair appears in every one of these 39 designs - from an 11 �-foot sailing pirogue to a 26 �-foot steam launch to a 115-foot full-rigged ship. In between are simple daysailers, cruising sharpies, fast powerboats, and lovely traditional sailing craft. His talent and eccentricities are self-evident - and only he can describe how own output in such an analytical yet entertaining fashion. The plans are reproduced large enough to allow close scrutiny, and there are designs for building in steel, aluminum, and wood (including cold-molding). Bolger tells you the origin of each design - sometimes a straightforward commission, sometimes a request for a solution to a specific problem, sometimes a contest that piqued his interest. And his solutions never fail to be unique. He also documents a few of his failures by sharing the lessons he learned. Interspersed among the relevant design comments (on leeboards, yulohs, bow steering, dipping lugs, sailboards) are philosophical arguments for and against various causes: taxation, equal rights, planned obsolescence, etymology, low-cost housing. The Bolger mind never rests. If you&#39;re already a Bolger fan, you now have a new prize for your collection; if you haven&#39;t met him via his earlier books, you have in your hands a great opportunity.</p><p></p><h2>How To Prevent Falls: Better Balance, Independence and Energy in 6 Simple Steps</h2><p>Description: The book How To Prevent Falls is based on Dr. Betty Perkins-Carpenter&#39;s unique Six Step Balance System, designed to teach seniors how to prevent falls and avoid potentially devastating injuries, while increasing energy and maintaining independence through a series of safe, easy and fun to do balance exercise activities.</p><p><b> "Every hour an older adult dies as the result of a fall," </b> according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In fact, 1 out of 3 over the age of 65 falls each year. <p> These statistics are frightening. And with the senior class growing at an alarming rate, we must look for better ways to teach fall prevention. Fortunately, for our mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers, Dr. Betty Perkins-Carpenter has created her unique Six-Step Balance System to do just that! It is the only proven system of its kind and it's found only in <i> How To Prevent Falls: Better Balance, Independence and Energy in 6 Simple Steps. </i> </p><p> For the "Baby Boomers" with aging parents, it is a great resource to give, because it is designed to improve balance, increase energy and mobility, reduce stress and promote greater independence through a series of safe and easy-to-do exercise activities. And what's even better, there is not expensive equipment to buy - all activities can be performed in the comfort and safety of home. </p><p> Unfortunately, when a loved-one falls they are more likely than not to suffer a hip fracture, which leads to the most severe health problems and reduced quality of life. Only half of older adults who were living independently before their hip fracture were able to live on their own a year later. This means that a fall will produce devastating effects that affect everyone in the family. For the sons and daughters of parents who are injured, their career, free-time and marriages often suffer as well. </p><p> Fortunately, <i> How To Prevent Falls: Better Balance, Independence and Energy in 6 Simple Steps</i> is the #1 resource for fall prevention and has already helped thousands live better, safer lives.</p>The new and revised edition of <i> How to Prevent Falls</i> incorporates the knowledge and experience obtained from more than 50 years of coaching and teaching. I've worked with infants and toddlers through my Fit by Five program. I've taught thousands of children and adults to swim and dive at the Perkins Swim Club in Rochester, New York. I've coached world-class divers in the 1976 Olympics and competitive divers at the high school and college levels. I currently teach senior citizens the concepts of fitness and balance - all to prevent falls. <p> Is this teaching and coaching experience relevant to the needs of senior adults?

Before becoming a full-time writer in 1991, he worked as a journalist. His French trilogy -- The Girl at the Lion d&#39;Or, Birdsong and Charlotte Gray (1989-1997) -- established him in the front rank of British novelists. UK sales of Birdsong exceed 2,500,000 copies, and for this novel he was named &#34;Author of the Year&#34; by the British Book Awards in 1995. It is regularly voted one of the nation&#39;s favourite books. Charlotte Gray has also sold over a million copies and was filmed with Cate Blanchett in the main part. Faulks&#39;s other novels include A Fool&#39;s Alphabet (1992), On Green Dolphin Street(2001), the epic Human Traces (2005), and most recently Engleby (2007). His biographical study of three doomed young men of the 20th century, The Fatal Englishman, was published in 1996 and a book of literary parodies, Pistache, in 2006.

Named one of <i>Granta's</i> "Best Young British Novelists," his works include Esau, which has been optioned for a major motion picture by Disney; <i>A Five-Year Plan,</i> which was bought for a major motion picture by Tom Cruise; and <i>The Second Angel.</i> Mr. Kerr lives in London.<p> <b>One: In the Kingdom of the White Caesars</b> </p><p> Helmut Gregor feared the sound of his real name as another man might have feared the name of his worst enemy. But thanks to the generous support of his family and the agricultural business that continued to thrive in G�nzberg, Bavaria, he managed to live very comfortably in Buenos Aires. An old but attractive capital -- it is a well-named city of good airs -- Buenos Aires has many fine boulevards and an excellent opera house, and on a cool July afternoon in 1960, the middle-aged German doctor could still think himself in his beloved Vienna, before the war -- before the defeat of Germany had necessitated such a protracted period of exile. For almost ten years he had resided in a quiet country house in the predominantly English suburb of Temperley. At least he had until now. After what had happened to Adolf Eichmann, Helmut Gregor considered it safer to move into the city center. And until he could find a suitable apartment in the <i>microcentro,</i> he was currently staying at the elegant and modern City Hotel. </p><p> Other old comrades, alarmed by the audacity of the kidnapping -- Eichmann had been snatched from his own house in San Fernando by Israeli intelligence agents and spirited away to Jerusalem -- had fled across the R�o de la Plata to Uruguay and the city of Montevideo. The cooler Helmut Gregor, noting the world's condemnation of Israel's violation of international law and the possibility that the Israeli embassy in Argentina might be forced to close down -- not to mention the rather satisfying wave of anti-Semitic violence that had recently occurred in Buenos Aires as a result of the illegal Israeli action -- had reasoned that in all probability Buenos Aires was now the safest city in all of South America. For him and others like him, at any rate. There seemed little chance of the same thing happening to Helmut Gregor as had happened to Eichmann. Especially now that sympathetic friends in the right-wing Argentinian government had arranged for him to have twenty-four-hour police protection. It was Gregor's opinion that by living in the middle of nowhere and lacking the kind of money that would have bought some protection, Adolf Eichmann had made it easy for his Israeli enemies. Even so, he had to admit that the Jews had carried off the operation with considerable flair. But he did not think they would, or could, snatch him from the biggest hotel in Buenos Aires. </p><p> Not that he stayed skulking indoors all day. Far from it. Like Vienna, Buenos Aires is a city made for walking; and like the ancient capital of Austria, it boasts some excellent coffee houses. So every afternoon at around three o'clock, and accompanied by the melancholic, swarthy-featured policeman who was his afternoon bodyguard -- but for the man's piercing blue eyes, Gregor would have said he looked more Gypsy than Spanish -- the German doctor would take a brisk walk to the Confiteria Ideal. </p><p> With its elaborate brass fittings, marble columns, and, in the late afternoons, an organist who played a medley of waltzes and tangos, the Ideal caf�, just off Corrientes, seemed a perfect evocation of old Austrian <i>Gem�tlichkeit.</i> After drinking his usual <i>cortado doble</i> and eating a slice of delicious chocolate cake, and having closed the cold dark eyes that had seen his own hands inflict a whole <i>Malabolgia</i> of horrors, it was quite possible for the doctor to imagine himself back in Vienna's Central Caf� on Herrengasse, anticipating a night at the Staatsoper or the Burgtheater. For a while anyway, until it was time to go. As he and his bodyguard collected their coats and left the Ideal at the usual time of a quarter to five, it would have been quite impossible for Helmut Gregor to have imagined himself in any way worse off than Adolf Eichmann. And yet he was. It would be another twenty-three months before Eichmann would meet the hangman in Ramleh Prison. But judgment was rather closer at hand for the doctor. Even as he was leaving the Ideal, one of the waiters, himself a Jew -- of whom there are a great many in Buenos Aires -- had ignored the doctor's generous tip and was calling the Continental Hotel. </p><p> "Sylvia? It's me. Moloch is on his way." </p><p><br> Sylvia replaced the hotel room's telephone receiver and nodded at the tall American who was lying on the big bed. He threw aside the new Ian Fleming he had been reading, stubbed out his cigarette, and, having climbed up on top of the large mahogany wardrobe, adopted a prone position. Sylvia did not think this behavior eccentric. Rather she admired him for the efficient professional way he approached his task. Admired him but feared him, too. </p><p> The Continental Hotel, on Roque Saenz Pena, was a classic Italian-style building, but it reminded the American of the Flatiron building in New York. The room was on the fifth-floor corner and through the open, double-height window, he could see right up the street to the corner of Suipacha -- a distance of over one hundred and fifty yards. The wardrobe creaked a little as he leaned toward the Winchester rifle that was already carefully positioned there between a couple of pillows. He always disliked poking a rifle out of an open window, preferring the comparative anonymity of a makeshift marksman's platform constructed inside the shooting position. Moving the wardrobe away from the wall by six or seven feet had created the perfect urban hide, rendering him virtually undetectable from the street or the office building opposite. Now all he had to worry about was the unsuppressed noise of the .30 caliber rifle when he squeezed the trigger. But even that, he hoped, had been taken care of: Sylvia was already signaling to a car parked on the other side of the street. The black De Soto, a popular car in Buenos Aires, was old and battered, with a tendency to backfire and, seconds later, there came a report, as loud as any rifle shot, that scattered the seagulls and pigeons like a handful of giant-sized confetti from off the ledge outside the window. </p><p> Not much of a ruse, thought the American, but it was better than nothing. And anyway, B.A. wasn't like his hometown of Miami where the locals weren't much used to the sound of firecrackers, or gunfire. Here there were plenty of public holidays, always celebrated at maximum volume, with cherry bombs and starting pistols, not to mention the odd revolution. It was only five years since the Argentinian air force had strafed the main square of the city during the military coup that had overthrown Per�n. Loud bangs and explosions were a way of life in Buenos Aires. And sometimes death. </p><p> Sylvia collected a pair of field binoculars and stood with her back against the wardrobe, immediately underneath the barrel of the rifle. More powerful than the 8X Unertl scope mounted on the American's rifle, the binoculars were to help her ensure that among the many pedestrians who passed along the length of Roque Saenz Pena, the target was properly spotted and a kill detected. Sylvia glanced at her watch as, in the street outside, the De Soto backfired once again. </p><p> Even with some cotton wool in her ears to stop her being deafened when the American finally pulled the trigger, the echo chamber effect of the backfire between the tall buildings of Cangallo and Roque sounded more like a bomb going off. </p><p> Having achieved a solid body position, the American took hold of the rifle butt with his nonshooting hand and pressed it firmly against his shoulder. Next, he clasped the grip, slid his forefinger through the trigger guard, and positioned his cheek against the smooth wooden stock. Only then did he check the eye relief through the scope. The sight was already zeroed, following an uncomfortable 350-mile round-trip the previous weekend, to the valley of the Azul River, where the American had shot several wild goats. But even with a correctly bore-sighted rifle, this promised to be a much more difficult target to hit than a goat. There was a considerable amount of traffic along Roque Saenz Pena and across Cangallo, to say nothing of the confusing effect of the ancient seaport's many cross winds. As if to confirm the difficulty of sniping in an urban environment, a <i>colectivo</i> -- one of the red Mercedes buses that served the city -- obscured his practice view through the scope just as he had been positioning the cross hairs of the reticle on an old <i>porte�o's</i> wide-brimmed hat. </p><p> "Moloch should be coming into view any second now," Sylvia said loudly, because, like her, the American was also wearing ear protection. </p><p> The American said nothing, already concentrating on his breathing cycle: before making a shot he had been trained to exhale normally, and then hold his breath for just a fraction of a second before squeezing the trigger. He had no doubt that Sylvia would correctly identify the target when he hove into view. Like the rest of the local Shin Bet team in Buenos Aires, she knew Moloch's face almost as well as she had come to know Eichmann's. And if the American did have a concern about her it was that he was relying on someone who had never before seen someone shot dead in cold blood to confirm that he had hit, or missed, his target. Any rifle's recoil prevented the shooter from seeing if he had hit his man. Especially when the target was standing more than a hundred yards away and in a crowd of people. At that kind of distance a shooter needed a spotter like a pitcher needs an umpire behind home plate, to call balls and strikes on the batter. The least amount of squeamish hesitation on her part and they risked losing the opportunity for a second shot. Observing bullet impacts was easy. Detecting a miss -- even the best marksman could miss -- and describing where the bullet went was the hard part. </p><p> The American held no opinion of his professional skills except to say that he was able to command a high fee for his services. It wasn't the kind of business where you could claim to be the best. Or indeed where others could legitimately claim that distinction for you. Moreover, he disliked that kind of reputation as much as he eschewed inflated claims of his own excellence. For him, discretion and reliability were the two defining features of his way of life and the fewer people there were who knew about what he did and how well he did it, the better. The most important part of the job was getting away with it, and that necessitated the kind of quiet, unassuming, unsigned behavior that was characteristic of only the most self-effacing of people. In none of this, however, did he consider himself to be at all atypical of anyone in that particular line of work. He knew there were other marksmen out there -- Sarti, Nicoli, David, Nicoletti, to name but a few -- but other than their names he knew very little about them, which told him that they aimed to be as anonymous as he was himself. His name was Tom Jefferson. </p><p> There was one thing he knew was quite unusual about his own situation, however, and this was that he was married, and to a girl who knew exactly what he did for a living. Who knew what he did and approved of it. </p><p><br> Mary accompanied Tom on the trip to Lake Tahoe to pick up the contract. That had been the plan anyway: things happened a little differently when they finally arrived in Lake Tahoe. </p><p> They flew Bonanza Air from Miami to Reno, and from there they drove to the Cal-Neva Lodge on the North Shore's Crystal Bay, at the invitation of a man named Irving Davidson. Mary, a second-generation Chinese, had never been to Tahoe, but she had seen the Cal-Neva's advertisements in the magazines -- "Heaven in the High Sierras" -- and she had read about how the resort was part-owned by Frank Sinatra and Peter Lawford, and how Marilyn Monroe was a frequent visitor there, as were members of the Kennedy family. Mary, as interested in the Kennedys as she was a fan of Monroe's, was keen to stay in such a glamorous spot. </p><p> And she took to the place as soon as she saw it. Or rather as soon as she saw Joe DiMaggio and Jimmy Durante having a drink in the Indian Room. But there was something about the Cal-Neva Tom didn't like. An atmosphere. Something indefinably corrupt. Perhaps it was because the operating philosophy of the place seemed to be that money could buy you everything. Or perhaps it was because the resort had been built by a wealthy San Francisco businessman with the express purpose of circumventing California law. Located on the state line dividing California and Nevada, the resort comprised a central rustic lodge with an enormous fireplace, a cluster of luxury chalets, and a casino that, because of the laws banning gambling in California, was located on the Nevada side of the border. The state line ran right through the middle of the swimming pool, enabling bathers to swim from one state to another. Tom was glad that, as things turned out, he only had to spend one night in the place. </p><p> Soon after their arrival it became clear that their host and potential client would be unable to join them. Telephoning the discreet chalet where Tom and Mary were relaxing together in the large hot tub, Irving Davidson explained the situation. </p><p> "Tom? May I call you Tom? I'm afraid that some business is going to detain me here in Las Vegas for a while. Look, I'm very sorry about this, but I'm not going to be able to come up there and join you. That being the case, for which once again you have my apologies Tom, I was wondering if I could prevail upon your time and patience a little further. I was wondering if you would mind driving down here to meet me and my associates here in Vegas. It's about four hundred and fifty miles down Highway 95. You could leave just after breakfast and be here late afternoon. It's a nice drive. Especially if you're in a nice car. Living in Miami, I bet you drive a convertible, Tom. Am I right?" </p><p> "Chevy Bel Air," confirmed Tom. </p><p> "That's a nice car," said Davidson. "Well, there's a Dual Ghia at your disposal while you're in Nevada, Tom. That's a really beautiful car. But here's the kick. It belongs to Frank Sinatra. How does that sound? And when you arrive in Vegas you can stay in the suite Frank has here at the Sands. Everything is fixed. What do you say, Tom?" </p><p> Tom, who had never much cared for Sinatra's music, was silent for a moment. He sensed that the suite was for him alone. "What about my wife?" he asked. </p><p> "Let her enjoy herself where she is. Listen, she's got everything she needs right there. A drive through the desert with the hood down, she doesn't need. Her hair doesn't need it. Her complexion doesn't need it. There's a pretty good beauty salon in the lodge. I've booked her a whole morning in there. And I've arranged for her to have five hundred dollars' worth of chips to play with in the casino. She needs anything else, all she's got to do is pick up the phone and Skinny'll fix it for her. That's Skinny D'Amato. The general manager? He knows all about how you and Mary are my special guests. I believe that some celebrity guests are coming in tomorrow. Eddie Fisher and Dean Martin. I can have Skinny introduce her if she wants. So what do you say, Tom?" </p><p> "Okay, Mr. Davidson. It's your party." </p><p> Early the next morning, Tom left Mary very excited about the possibility of meeting Dean Martin and drove Sin...</p></p><h2>A Taint in the Blood: A Kate Shugak Novel (Kate Shugak Mysteries)</h2><p>Thirty-one years ago in Anchorage, Alaska, Victoria Pilz Bannister Muravieff was convicted of murdering her seventeen-year-old son William.

For well-connected officers, it meant polo at the Gezira Club and drinks at Shepheard's.

The political scene was dominated by the British Ambassador Sir Miles Lampson. In February 1942 he surrounded the Abdin Palace with tanks and attempted to depose King Farouk. Five months later it looked as if the British would be thrown out of Egypt for good.

In his newest book he directs our attention to the psychology of our culture by providing a distinctly American portrait of the place--and displacements--of myth in our society. As is customary for this author, the text weaves case studies and considerable literary exegesis into his cogent analyses. May demonstrates his thesis--that "Each myth in human history is interpreted according to the needs of the society which it reflects"--and keeps good his promise to provide an American audience currently interested in the mythic realms of other cultures (witness the popularity of Joseph Campbell's works) with insight on our own mythology.

The text, simple and repetitive, with a pounding beat and an irreverent outlook, begins, ``Mommy had a little baby. /There he is fast asleep. /He's just a little plaything. /Why not wake him up?''

Its enormous impact on the world in terms of international diplomacy and politics, and the ways in which future military engagements would evolve, be fought, and ultimately get resolved have been ignored. With this reader of primary and secondary documents, edited and compiled by Michael S. Neiberg, students, scholars, and war buffs can gain an extensive yet accessible understanding of this conflict. Neiberg introduces the basic problems in the history of World War I, shares the words and experiences of the participants themselves, and, finally, presents some of the most innovative and dynamic current scholarship on the war. <br>Neiberg, a leading historian of World War I, has selected a wide array of primary documents, ranging from government papers to personal diaries, demonstrating the war&#x2019;s devastating effect on all who experienced it, whether President Woodrow Wilson, an English doughboy in the trenches, or a housewife in Germany. In addition to this material, each chapter in <b>The World War I Reader</b> contains a selection of articles and book chapters written by major scholars of World War I, giving readers perspectives on the war that are both historical and contemporary. Chapters are arranged chronologically and by theme, and address causes, the experiences of soldiers and their leaders, battlefield strategies and conditions, home front issues, diplomacy, and peacemaking. A time-line, maps, suggestions for further reading, and a substantive introduction by Neiberg that lays out the historiography of World War I round out the book.</p></p><p><b>Michael S.

Then he befriends smart and lively Lizzie Bright Griffin, a girl from Malaga Island, a poor community founded by former slaves. Lizzie shows Turner a new world along the Maine coast from digging clams to rowing a boat next to a whale. When the powerful town elders, including Turner&#x2019;s father, decide to drive the people off the island to set up a tourist business, Turner stands alone against them. He and Lizzie try to save her community, but there&#x2019;s a terrible price to pay for going against the tide.</p><p>Gary D. Schmidt has written several novels for children and young adults. He lives in Alto, Michigan.Boston and Phippsburg are close geographically, but 13-year-old Tucker Buckminster, who moves to Maine with his minister father, discovers they are two different worlds. He tries to fit in but the door is firmly shut until he finds friendship with old Mrs. Heard and sprightly Lizzie Bright. From the beginning, Sam Freed portrays Tucker as open, caring, and honest as he faces his new life. Freed doesn't differentiate the many characters, but his Maine accent is superb. Freed superbly conveys Tucker's innocence and na�vet� as he faces prejudice, his wonder and awe at communing with the whales, and finally his growing strength of character and sense of self.

Eight projects complete with moving parts are featured including a police car, taxi, ambulance, convertible car, dump truck, VW Beetle, bus, and fire truck. Geared toward crocheters with intermediate skill levels, readily accessible materials such as plastic canvas, dowels, straws, hot glue gun and a saw to cut the dowels are required.

Their improvisational compositions and the perceptually derived canvases of the East Coast realists marked the regeneration of representational painting at the height of Abstract Expressionism and Greenbergian Formalism. Theophilus Brown first achieved national attention more than a half century ago with his &#39;football&#39; paintings, but the visual and thematic character of this work began to crystallize when he moved to Berkeley and enrolled in the graduate studio program at the University of California. Always a figurative painter, Brown&#39;s aesthetic sensibility was formed through his post-war contact with Picasso, Braque, Giacometti, and others in Paris; the influence of Willem de Koonig&#39;s mentoring in New York; and his heady rapport with David Park, Elmer Bischoff, Richard Diebenkorn, Paul Wonner, James Weeks, and Nathan Oliviera in Berkeley. Today this close knit and highly influential group, known here and abroad as the Bay Area figurative painters, has attained legendary status in twentieth century American art.</p><p>John Arthur is an independent curator, writer, and art advisor.

Sunshine Dabbs is Ucute as can be," even if she is a bit unconventional, which should hardly come as a shock to Mary Alicc given that she's the one who raised her boy. But with all her motherly instincts, Mary Alice is sure that this sweet little blonde Barbie doll--who met her son in Bora Bora after she won the trip on Wheel of Fortune--thinks she's found herself a fortune in Ray's hefty wallet. <p>The sisters can't wait to get a look at Sunshine's family, and quite a look it turns out to be. As soon as Meemaw Turkett invites Mary Alice and Patricia Anne into her cozy trailer on the family compound they stumble over a corpse, and Meemaw's best hog butchering knife is stuck in its chest. Meemaw, a Cabbage Patch look-alike and Sunshine's grandmother, guardian, and the family matriarch is shocked to pieces and immediately summons the family to her trailer. Pawpaw, a lovable bearded grump has his own trailer, and their grown kids each enjoy a private home-away-from-home on the five-trailer compound. </p><p>The discovery of the mysterious body brings in Mary Alice's nemesis, good ol' boy Sheriff Reuse, who, she knows from her experience at the Skoot 'n' Boot, is nothing but trouble. Within minutes, the compound is strewn with a weird collection of friends, neighbors and relatives. There's Meemaw's spooky channeler, ready to give guidance as needed; Sunshine's jilted boyfriend skulking around; a bunch of dogs ready to attack...and Kerrigan, Sunshine's mostly absentee mama, who stars in the kind of video flicks that might even shock Mary Alice.</p></p><p>Anne George (c.____ - 2001) was the Agatha Award-winning author of the <em>Southern Sisters</em> mystery series which culminate in <em>Murder Boogies with Elvis</em>, publishing in August 2001.

Being a true lady of the Old South, her date of birth will forever be a mystery.Mary Alice and I grinned at each other. We each have three children, all in their thirties now (Dear God! Sister's Marilyn and Freddie, our oldest, would soon be forty!), but with the exception of my middle child, Alan, who has two teenaged boys, none of the others has been in a hurry to produce grandchildren for us to spoil. <p>"Is Sunshine's family going to be there tomorrow night?" I asked. </p><p>"Not her mother. She's out of town. Meemaw will, though." </p><p>"Meemaw?" </p><p>"That's what she called her. Her grandmother." </p><p>"I'm assuming Meemaw has a name." </p><p>Mary Alice frowned. "And I don't know what it is. It was 'Meemaw this' and 'Meemaw that' and I forgot to ask. How do you think I can find out? I hate to introduce her as Meemaw Dabbs. You know? God, I can't believe Ray has done this." </p><p>"It wouldn't be Meemaw Dabbs, anyway. Not if she's Sunshine's mother's mother." </p><p>Mary Alice stirred her tea with her finger. "True." </p><p>From outside, I could hear my old Woofer dog barking. It was too hot for him to be getting excited about anything; I needed to go put some ice in his water bowl. But just at that moment, a cloud crossed the sun. A precursor of the usual late afternoon August thunderstorms. I watched Sister stir her tea; my shoulders ached and I was suddenly very sleepy. </p><p>"Hey!" she said. </p><p>I jumped a mile. </p><p>"Locust Fork's in Blount County, isn't it?" </p><p>"I don't know. Why?" </p><p>"Reckon how many people live there?" </p><p>"Not many, I wouldn't think." </p><p>"I'll bet I know someone who knows Meemaw's name." </p><p>"Who?" </p><p>"Sheriff Reuse. I'll bet that martinet knows everybody's dog's name and if they've had their rabies shots." </p><p>"Call him," I said. "He'll be thrilled to hear from you." My sister and Sheriff Reuse had met the year before when she had gotten a wild hair and bought a country-western bar renamed the Skoot 'n' Boot. Nothing but trouble. Suffice it to say she and Sheriff Reuse were not soul mates. </p><p>"You're being sarcastic, but I bet he'll be happy to hear from me. That man leads a boring life, Patricia Anne." </p><p>"Hmmm." What could I say? </p><p>"Where's your phone book?" </p><p>I located it under the newspaper that was spread on the kitchen counter and followed her into the den. This I wanted to hear. </p><p>I got the one-sided version, of course, but it went some thing like this: </p><p>Mary Alice (butter-melting voice): "Sheriff Reuse? How are you? It's so nice to hear your voice! This is Mary Alice Crane." (Pause. Voice still sweet.) No everything's fine. No, I haven't invested in any more property up there. I know, though I really don't feel responsible for what happened." </p><p>(Long pause. Voice not as sweet.) "What I need to know is if you know a family in Locust Fork by the name of Dabbs." (Pause.) "No, I am not buying their property, I assure you." (Nod.) "Sunshine Dabbs is the child's name. Well, it's Sunshine Crane now. She and my son Ray just got married in Bora Bora." (Pause.) "Bora Bora in the South Pacific." (Another nod.) "Yes. And what I need to know is the grandmother's name. All I know is 'Meemaw' and I'm having a dinner party tomorrow night and it would be embarrassing to have to introduce my new daughter-in-law's grandmother and not know her name." (Pause.) "Yes, my son married Sunshine Dabbs. The dinner is tomorrow night. Of course Meemaw is invited." (Disgusted look at me. Holds the phone away from her ear.) "He's laughing." </p><p>"Sheriff Reuse doesn't laugh." </p><p>"Well, he's putting on a damn good imitation." She handed the phone to me. The sheriff was either laughing, crying, or choking to death. </p><p>"Sheriff Reuse?" I asked. "This is Patricia Anne Hollowell. Is something wrong?" </p><p>"Turkett," he gasped finally. </p><p>"What?" </p><p>"Turkett. Her name is Turkett." </p><p>"Like little turkey? Turkett?" </p><p>"There is a God." The gargling sounds started again and the line went dead. </p><p>Mary Alice and I looked at each other. </p><p>"What on God's earth do you suppose that was about?" she asked. </p><p>"I have no idea. He said there was a God and hung up. Oh, and he said her name was Turkett." </p><p>"What Turkett?" </p><p>"I don't know. He was laughing too hard." I held out the phone. "You want to call him back?" </p><p>"Turkett?" </p><p>"Like little turkey. And then he said there was a God and hung up." </p><p>"Meemaw Turkett?" </p><p>"Maybe Sunshine will say her name." </p><p>Mary Alice put the phone back on the end table. "Shouldn't have called that fool anyway." </p><p>"True." I meant it. </p><p>She got up. "Y'all come about seven. Okay?" </p><p>"I'm looking forward to it," I said truthfully. </p><p>Sister started out the back door. "What are y'all having for supper tonight?" </p><p>"Lean Cuisines if Fred doesn't stop by Morrison's Cafeteria." </p><p>"The paint smells too loud in here to eat anyway." </p><p>"We'll probably take it to the bedroom. Eat in bed." </p><p>"You wish." </p><p>I was shutting the door when she turned around. "Turkett? You're sure?" </p><p>I nodded. </p><p>"Reckon why he was laughing so? There's nothing wrong with that name. Not Smith or Jones, but it's a fine name." </p><p>I shrugged. Sheriff Reuse's laugh had been disconcerting to say the least. </p><p>From the west came the first rumble of thunder. I waved at Mary Alice and shut the door. Meemaw Turkett? I grabbed the paintbrush and climbed back on the counter.

Livio Fanzaga&#x2019;s The Deceiver: Our Daily Battle with Satan&#x2014;the top-selling religious book in Italy in 2000, now in English from Roman Catholic Books. Fr. Fanzaga, the Rome&nbsp;educated and Vatican-endorsed writer and director of Europe&#x2019;s largest Catholic radio network, warns: Efforts to soft-pedal the reality and continuous threat of the devil have left many Catholics &#x201c;unarmed and unprepared&#x201d; to resist him. But the question is: How does Satan tempt and deceive us? How can we see through him, and resist him? Drawing dazzlingly from Scripture, tradition, saints&#x2019; lives, and his pastoral experience, Fr. Fanzaga supplies practical answers: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Widespread misconceptions about Satan, his methods and his powers (shared by not a few devout Catholics) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How Satan &#x201c;personalizes&#x201d; temptations to take advantage of your peculiar weaknesses &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two &#x201c;fundamental activities&#x201d; of Satan, seen in Scripture &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The False Benefactor: how Satan always has something seemingly &#x201c;good&#x201d; to offer at the moment of temptation &nbsp;</p><p></p><h2>The Artist&#39;s Joke (Whitechapel: Documents of Contemporary Art)</h2><p><p><b>Jokes and humor in avant-garde and contemporary art, as discussed by writers and artists ranging from Freud and Picasso to Andrea Fraser, the Guerilla Girls, and Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek.</b></p><p>Ever since Freud's <i>Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious</i> appeared in 1905, humor both light and dark has frequently surfaced as a subversive, troubling, or liberating element in art. <i>The Artist's Joke</i> surveys the rich and diverse uses of humor by avant-garde and contemporary artists. The texts collected in this new reader from London's Whitechapel Gallery examine what Andr� Breton called the &#x201c;lightning bolt&#x201d; of the unsettlingly comic, as seen in the anarchic wordplay of Duchamp, Picasso, the Dadaists, and Surrealists; Pop's fetish for kitsch and the comic strip; Bruce Nauman's sinister clowns and twisted puns; Richard Prince's joke paintings; art ambushed by feminist wit, from the Dadaism of Hannah H�ch in the 1920s to the politicized conceptualism of Jenny Holzer and Barbara Kruger in the 1980s; the serenely uncanny in Mike Kelley's installations and the risibly grotesque in Paul McCarthy's; and the strangely comic scenarios of artists as various as Maurizio Cattelan, Andrea Fraser, Raymond Pettibon, and David Shrigley. Artists' writings are accompanied and contextualized by the work of critics and thinkers including Freud, Bergson, H�l�ne Cixous, Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek, J�rg Heiser, Jo Anna Isaak, and Ralph Rugoff.

As a Supervisory Special Agent with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, he reported directly to BSU chief John Douglas, and with other experts, developed the Crime Classification Manual, a system for standardizing violent crimes into categories. Since retiring from the FBI in 1995, he has taught forensic psychology at Marymount University and Nova Southeastern University. McCrary continues to consult and provide expert testimony in cases in which crime scene analysis is key, and provides expert commentary to <i>NBC, ABC, CBS,</i> and <i>CNN.</i>Many of us may think we know quite a lot about FBI profilers, but, says the former supervisor of the bureau's behavioral science unit, our knowledge comes almost entirely from fictionalized portrayals in films like <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> and television series like <i>Profiler</i>. The truth, he tells us, is rather different from fiction. This book, cowritten with forensic psychology professor Ramsland, puts profiling in the context of a more comprehensive program called Criminal Investigative Analysis. (Some readers may wonder why the FBI gives its behavioral-assessment program a name whose acronym is CIA.) Using actual cases in which he participated, McCrary demonstrates how profiling is but one part of this multifaceted crime-solving program. His explanation of the nuts and bolts of it all is surprisingly lively and will captivate true-crime fans with a yen to know more about profiling and related investigative practices. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This most memorable of McMurtry&#39;s novels, set in a sleepy Texas town, tells of teenagers taking the final steps from childhood to adulthood.</p><p>In <i>The Last Picture Show</i> Larry McMurtry introduced characters who would show up again in later novels, <i>Texasville</i> and <i>Duane's Depressed</i>. This first volume of the trilogy drops the reader into the one-stoplight town of Thalia, Texas, where Duane Moore, his buddy Sonny, and his girlfriend Jacy are all stumbling along the rocky road to adulthood. Duane wants nothing more than to marry Jacy; Sonny wants what Duane has; and Jacy wants to get the hell out of Thalia any way she can. This is not a novel of big ideas or defining moments; over the course of a year Duane and Jacy make up and break up, Sonny begins an affair with his high-school football coach's wife, and the only movie house in town closes its doors forever. Yet it is out of these small-town experiences--a nude swimming party in Wichita, a failed sexual encounter during a senior trip, a botched elopement, an enlistment--that McMurtry builds his tale and reveals his characters' hearts. No epiphanies here, just a lot of hard-won experience that leaves none of his protagonists particularly wiser, though they're all a little sadder by the end. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Little House in the Big Woods</h2><p>LITTLE HOUSE.

He spent a brief period working for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank before abandoning finance for writing, earning a living by journalism and selling stories to magazines. An enormously popular and prolific writer, he produced about 100 books. In Jeeves, the ever resourceful &#39;gentleman&#39;s personal gentleman&#39;, and the good-hearted young blunderer Bertie Wooster, he created two of the best known and best loved characters in twentieth century literature. Their exploits, first collected in Carry On, Jeeves, were chronicled in fourteen books, and have been repeatedly adapted for television, radio and the stage. Wodehouse also created many other comic figures, notably Lord Emsworth, the Hon. Galahad Threepwood, Psmith and the numerous members of the Drones Club. He was part-author and writer of fifteen straight plays and 250 lyrics for some 30 msical comedies. The Times hailed him as a &#39;comic genius recognized in his lifetime as a classic and an old master of farce&#39;. P. G. Wodehouse said, &#39;I believe there are two ways of writing novels. One is mine, making a sort of musical comedy without music and ignoring real life altogether; the other is going right deep down into life and not caring a damn ... &#39; Wodehouse married in 1914 and took American citizenship in 1955. He was created a Knight of the British Empire in the 1975 New Year&#39;s Honours List. In a BBC interview he said that he had no ambitions left now that he had been knighted and there was a waxwork of him in Madame Tussauds. He died on St Valentines Day, 1975, at the age of ninety-three.</p><h2>A Colossal Wreck: A Road Trip Through Political Scandal, Corruption and American Culture</h2><p><p>Alexander Cockburn was without question one of the most influential journalists of his generation, whose writing stems from the best tradition of Mark Twain, H.L. Menchken and Tom Paine. <i>Colossal Wreck</i>, his final work, finished shortly before his death in July 2012, exemplifies the prodigious literary brio that made Cockburn&#x2019;s name.</p><p>Whether ruthlessly exposing Beltway hypocrisy, pricking the pomposity of those in power, or tirelessly defending the rights of the oppressed, Cockburn never pulled his punches and always landed a blow where it mattered. In this panoramic work, covering nearly two decades of American culture and politics, he explores subjects as varied as the sex life of Bill Clinton and the best way to cook wild turkey. He stands up for the rights of prisoners on death row and exposes the chicanery of the media and the duplicity of the political elite. As he pursues a serpentine path through the nation, he charts the fortunes of friends, famous relatives, and sworn enemies alike to hilarious effect.</p><p>This is a thrilling trip through the reefs and shoals of politics and everyday life. Combining a passion for the places, the food and the people he encountered on dozens of cross-country journeys, Cockburn reports back over seventeen years of tumultuous change among what he affectionately called the &#x201c;thousand landscapes&#x201d; of the United States.</p></p><p><b>Alexander Cockburn</b> (1941&#x2013;2012) was the coeditor of <i>CounterPunch </i>and the author of a number of titles, including <i>Corruptions of Empire</i>, <i>The Golden Age Is in Us</i>, <i>Washington Babylon </i>(with Ken Silverstein), and&nbsp;<i>Imperial Crusades</i>. One of three brothers, all journalists, he was the son of the journalist and author Claud Cockburn. Born in Ireland and educated in Scotland and England, he moved to America in 1972, soon establishing himself as a radical reporter and commentator, writing for the <i>Village Voice</i>, the <i>New York Review of Books</i>, <i>Esquire </i>and <i>Harpers</i>. He also wrote regular columns for the <i>Nation</i>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>New Statesman</i>, and his influential newsletter <i>CounterPunch</i>.

Having shaped such films as The Lion King, Mulan and Beauty and the Beast to name a few, Hans&#39;s work is a part of the very cultural fabric of our age. Here the artist puts on display the rarely discussed first part of image making for film, the conceptual thumbnail. Exquisitely beautiful in themselves, these small illustrations represent the birth of what eventually becomes the iconic images we experience on the silver screen. Essential to anyone interested in understanding the skeletal structure that exists underneath stunning imagery in all forms of media, this book is especially relevant today with the dramatic increase of interest in film and game design. Although students today have ready access to and an understanding of technical aspects of the craft using associated software, the area most lacking in accessible information is this quintessential first part of thumb-nailing an image. This unique book will provide the student and professional with the fundamentals of conceptualizing images, and how these can be used in composition in the related fields of illustration, graphic novels, 2D animation, 3D animation, photography and cinematography.</p><p>Production designer Hans Bacher is acknowledged as one of the legends in animation film design. His work with Walt Disney Feature Animation, Richard Williams, and Steven Spielberg&#39;s Amblimation saw him creating the production design for such historic films as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Balto, Hercules, Fantasia 2000, Little Match Girl, Brother Bear, Lilo and Stitch and Mulan amongst others. He is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and has been honored with the Golden Camera Award and an Annie for outstanding individual achievement in Production Design. He now lives in Singapore were he teaches as Nanyang Technological University.</p><h2>Fahrenheit 451</h2><p>A not-too-distant future where happiness is allocated on a TV screen, where individuals and scholars are outcasts and where books are burned by a special task force of firemen. Montag, trained by the state to be a destroyer, throws away his can of kerosene and begins to read a book.</p><p>In <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, Ray Bradbury's classic, frightening vision of the future, firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books. Bradbury's vividly painted society holds up the appearance of happiness as the highest goal--a place where trivial information is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Fire Captain Beatty explains it this way, "Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs.... Don't give them slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy." <p> Guy Montag is a book-burning fireman undergoing a crisis of faith. His wife spends all day with her television "family," imploring Montag to work harder so that they can afford a fourth TV wall. Their dull, empty life sharply contrasts with that of his next-door neighbor Clarisse, a young girl thrilled by the ideas in books, and more interested in what she can see in the world around her than in the mindless chatter of the tube. When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Montag is moved to make some changes, and starts hiding books in his home. Eventually, his wife turns him in, and he must answer the call to burn his secret cache of books. After fleeing to avoid arrest, Montag winds up joining an outlaw band of scholars who keep the contents of books in their heads, waiting for the time society will once again need the wisdom of literature.</p><p> Bradbury--the author of more than 500 short stories, novels, plays, and poems, including <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> and <i>The Illustrated Man</i>--is the winner of many awards, including the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America. Readers ages 13 to 93 will be swept up in the harrowing suspense of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, and no doubt will join the hordes of Bradbury fans worldwide. <i>--Neil Roseman</i></p>FARENHEIT 451 by Ray Bradbury<br>There are some books that no matter how long ago you've read them, details<br>from the story stick in your mind.

The regimes were universally harsh. Punishment was cruel and excessive. The children were deprived of proper food, medical, and psychological care. They &#39;lost&#39; their education, working much of their time instead as slave labour. They were abused physically, mentally and sexually. In 1999, Bertie Ahern apologised on behalf of the State and set in place a reconciliation procedure, its methods secretive and flawed. It did not reconcile. This was the final betrayal of thousands of former inmates whose lives had been deeply affected, and in many cases ruined, by what had happened. This is the story of how &#39;The Irish Gulag&#39; came into existence, how it was exposed, how those who had suffered were paid off, in secret, and were yet denied proper public reconciliation. In a series of moves charted in this book, the State&#39;s main purpose is shown as self-protection, not recompense. Carried out in collaboration with the Church, this was at the heart of the betrayal of innocent children. &#39;...the most complete explanation of the system that has shamed us before the world and the society that allowed it all to happen.

No Fair!</i>A Stranger with a Camera<br><br>Jeremiah, Kentucky<br><br>APRIL 1969<br><br>On a bright afternoon in September, in 1967, a five-�man film crew working in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky stopped to take pictures of some people near a place called Jeremiah. In a narrow valley, a half-�dozen dilapidated shacks&#x2014;�each one a tiny square box with one corner cut away to provide a cluttered front porch&#x2014;�stood alongside the county blacktop. Across the road from the shacks, a mountain rose abruptly. In the field that separated them from the mountain behind them, there were a couple of ramshackle privies and some clotheslines tied to trees and a railroad track and a rusted automobile body and a dirty river called Rockhouse Creek. The leader of the film crew was a Canadian named Hugh O&#x2019;Connor. Widely acclaimed as the co-�producer of the Labyrinth show at Expo 67 in Montreal, O&#x2019;Connor had been hired by Francis Thompson, an American filmmaker, to work on a film Thompson was producing for the American pavilion at HemisFair in San Antonio. O&#x2019;Connor went up to three of the shacks and asked the head of each household for permission to take pictures. When each one agreed, O&#x2019;Connor had him sign the customary release forms and gave him a token payment of ten dollars&#x2014;�a token that, in this case, happened to represent a month&#x2019;s rent. The light was perfect in the valley, and the shooting went well. Theodore Holcomb, the associate producer of the film, was particularly struck by the looks of a miner, still in his work clothes and still covered with coal dust, sitting in a rocking chair on one of the porches. &#x201c;He was just sitting there scratching his arm in a listless way,&#x201d; Holcomb said later. &#x201c;He had an expression of total despair. It was an extraordinary shot&#x2014;�so evocative of the despair of that region.&#x201d;<br><br>The shot of the coal miner was good enough to be included in the final version of the film, and so was a shot of a half-�dozen children who, somehow, lived with their parents in one of the tiny shacks. After about an hour and a half, the crew was ready to leave, but someone had noticed a woman come out of one of the shacks and go to the common well to draw some water, and she was asked to repeat the action for filming. As that last shot was being completed, a woman drove up and told the filmmakers that the man who owned the property was coming to throw them off of it. Then she drove away. A couple of minutes later, another car arrived, and a man&#x2014;�a thin, bald man&#x2014;�leaped out. He was holding a pistol. &#x201c;Get off my property!&#x201d; he shouted again and again. Then he shot twice. No one was hit. The filmmakers kept moving their equipment �toward their cars across the road while trying to tell the man that they were leaving. One of them said that the man must be shooting blanks. &#x201c;Get off my property!&#x201d; he kept screaming. Hugh O&#x2019;Connor, who was lugging a heavy battery across the highway, turned to say that they were going. The man held the pistol in both hands and pulled the trigger again. &#x201c;Mr. O&#x2019;Connor briefly looked down in amazement, and I saw a hole in his chest,&#x201d; Holcomb later testified in court. &#x201c;He saw it and he looked up in despair and said, &#x2018;Why did you have to do that?&#x2019; and, with blood coming from his mouth, he fell to the ground.&#x201d;<br><br>Whitesburg, a town about twelve miles from Jeremiah, is the county seat of Letcher County&#x2014;�headquarters for the county court, the sheriff, and assorted coal companies and antipoverty agencies. Word that someone had been killed reached Whitesburg quickly, but for a couple of hours there was some confusion about just who the victim was. According to various stories, the dead man had been a representative of the Army Corps of Engineers, a VISTA volunteer, or a CBS cameraman&#x2014;�any of whom might qualify as a candidate for shooting in Letcher County. The Corps of Engineers had proposed building the Kingdom Come Dam across Rockhouse Creek, thereby flooding an area that included Jeremiah, and some opponents of the dam had been saying that the first government man who came near their property had better come armed. Throughout Eastern Kentucky, local political organizations and coal-�mining interests had warned that community organizers who called themselves Vistas or Appalachian Volunteers or anything else were nothing but another variety of Communists&#x2014;�three of them had been arrested on charges of attempting to overthrow the government of Pike County&#x2014;�and even some of the impoverished people whom the volunteers were supposedly in Kentucky to help viewed them with fear and suspicion. A number of television crews had been to Letcher County to record the despair that Holcomb saw in the face of the miner sitting on the front porch. Whitesburg happens to be the home of Harry M. Caudill, a lawyer who drew attention to the plight of the mountain people in 1963 with an eloquent book called Night Comes to the Cumberlands. Television crews and reporters on a tour of Appalachia are tempted to start with Letcher County in order to get the benefit of Caudill&#x2019;s counsel, which is ordinarily expressed in a tone of sustained rage&#x2014;�rage at the profit ratio of out-�of-�state companies that take the region&#x2019;s natural resources while paying virtually no taxes, rage at the strip mines that are gouged across the mountains and at the mudslides and floods and pollution and ugliness they cause, rage at the local merchants and politicians who make a good living from the trade of welfare recipients or the retainers of coal companies and insist that there is nothing wrong with the economy, and, most of all, rage at the country that could permit it all to happen. &#x201c;Look what man hath wrought on that purple mountain&#x2019;s majesty,&#x201d; he will say as he points out the coal waste on the side of a mountain that had once been beautiful. &#x201c;A country that treats its land and people this way deserves to perish from the earth.&#x201d;<br><br>In the view of Caudill and of Tom Gish, the liberal editor of The Mountain Eagle, a Letcher County weekly, the reactions of people in Jeremiah to the presence of O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s film crew&#x2014;�cooperation by the poor people being photographed in their squalid shacks, rage by the man who owned the shacks&#x2014;�were characteristic of Letcher County: a lot of people who are still in Eastern Kentucky after years of welfare or subsistence employment have lost the will to treat their situation as an embarrassment, but outside journalists are particularly resented by the people who have managed to make a living&#x2014;�running a country store or a filling station or a small truck mine, working for the county administration, managing some rental property. They resent the impression that everyone in Eastern Kentucky is like the people who are desperately poor&#x2014;�people whose condition they tend to blame on &#x201c;just sorriness, mostly.&#x201d; In Letcher County, fear of outsiders by people who are guarding reputations or economic interests blends easily into a deep-�rooted suspicion of outsiders by all Eastern Kentucky mountain people, who have always had a fierce instinct to protect their property and a distrust of strangers that has often proved to have been justified. All of the people in Letcher County&#x2014;�people who live in the shacks up remote hollows or people who run stores on Main Street in Whitesburg&#x2014;�consider themselves mountain people, and, despite an accurate story in The Mountain Eagle, many of them instinctively believed that the mountaineer who killed Hugh O&#x2019;Connor was protecting his property from smart-�aleck outsiders who wouldn&#x2019;t leave when they were told.<br><br>The mountaineer&#x2019;s name was Hobart Ison. There have always been Isons in Letcher County, and many of them have managed somewhat better than their neighbors. Hobart Ison had inherited a rather large piece of land in Jeremiah&#x2014;�he raised chickens and rented out shacks he himself had built and at one time ran a small sawmill&#x2014;�but he was known mainly as an eccentric, mean-�tempered old man. Everyone in Letcher County knew that Hobart Ison had once built and furnished a house for his future bride and&#x2014;�having been rejected or having been afraid to ask or having had no particular future bride in mind&#x2014;�had let the house remain as it was for thirty years, the grass growing up around it and the furniture still in the packing crates. He had occasionally painted large signs attacking the people he thought had wronged him. He was easily enraged by people hunting on his property, and he despised all of the local Democrats, whom he blamed for injustices that included dismissing him from a post-�office job. A psychiatrist who examined him after the shooting said, &#x201c;Any reference to &#x2018;game warden&#x2019; or &#x2018;Democrat&#x2019; will provoke him tremendously.&#x201d; Once, when some local youths were taunting him, he took a shot at them, hitting one in the shoulder. &#x201c;A lot of people around here would have welcomed them,&#x201d; Caudill said of the filmmakers. &#x201c;They just happened to pick the wrong place.&#x201d;<br><br>Streams of people came to visit Ison in the Letcher County jail before he was released on bail. Women from around Jeremiah baked him cakes. When his trial came up, it proved impossible to find a jury. The Letcher County commonwealth&#x2019;s attorney and Caudill, who had been retained by Francis Thompson, Inc., secured a change of venue. They argued that Ison&#x2019;s family relationship in Letcher County was &#x201c;so extensive as to comprise a large segment of the population,&#x201d; and, through an affidavit signed by three citizens in a position to know public opinion, they stated that &#x201c;the overwhelming expression of sentiment has been to the effect that the defendant did right in the slaying of Hugh O&#x2019;Connor and that he ought to be acquitted of the offense of murder.&#x201d;<br><br>Harlan County is a mountain or two away from Letcher County. In the town of Harlan, benches advertising Bunny enriched bread stand outside the front door of the county courthouse, flanking the First World War monument and the Revolutionary War monument and the plaque recalling how many Kentucky courthouses were burned down by each side during the Civil War. On the ground floor of the courthouse, the men who habitually gather on the plain wooden benches to pass the time use old No. 5 cans for ashtrays or spittoons and a large container that once held Oscar Mayer pure lard as a wastebasket. In the courtroom, a plain room with all of its furnishings painted black, the only decoration other than pictures of the men who have served as circuit judge is a framed poster in praise of the country lawyer&#x2014;�and also in praise, it turns out upon close reading, of the Dun &amp; Bradstreet corporation. The front door of the courthouse is almost always plastered with election stickers. In the vestibule just inside, an old man sits on the floor behind a display of old pocketknives and watchbands and billfolds and eyeglass cases offered for sale or trade.<br><br>The commonwealth&#x2019;s attorney of Harlan County is Daniel Boone Smith. Eight or nine years ago, Smith got curious about how many people he had prosecuted or defended for murder, and counted up seven hundred and fifty. He was able to amass that total partly because of longevity (except for a few years in the service during the Second World War, he has been commonwealth&#x2019;s attorney continuously since 1933), partly because he has worked in an area that gives anyone interested in trying murder cases plenty of opportunity (the wars between the unions and the coal operators in Harlan County during the thirties were almost as bloody as the mountain feuds earlier in the century), and partly because he happens to be a quick worker (&#x201c;Some people will take three days to try a murder case,&#x201d; he has said. &#x201c;I usually get my case on in a day&#x201d;). During his first week as commonwealth&#x2019;s attorney of Harlan and an adjoining county, Smith tried five murder cases. These days, Harlan County may have about that many a year, but it remains a violent place. The murders that do occur in mountain counties like Harlan and Letcher often seem to occur while someone is in a drunken rage, and often among members of the same family&#x2014;�a father shooting a son over something trivial, one member of a family mowing down another who is breaking down the door trying to get at a third. &#x201c;We got people in this county today who would kill you as quick as look at you,&#x201d; Smith has said. &#x201c;But most of &#x2019;em are the type that don&#x2019;t bother you if you leave them alone.&#x201d; Smith is known throughout Eastern Kentucky for his ability to select jurors&#x2014;�to remember which prospective juror&#x2019;s uncle may have had a boundary dispute with which witness&#x2019;s grandfather twenty years ago&#x2014;�and for his ability to sum up the case for them in their own language once the evidence has been heard. He is an informal, colloquial, storytelling man who happens to be a graduate of Harvard Law School.<br><br>A lack of fervor about convicting Hobart Ison was assumed in Harlan County when he came up for trial there in May 1968. &#x201c;Before the case, people were coming up and saying, &#x2018;He should&#x2019;ve killed the son of a bitch,&#x2019; &#x201d; Smith said later. &#x201c;People would say, &#x2018;They oughtn&#x2019;t to make fun of mountain people. They&#x2019;ve made enough fun of mountain people. Let me on the jury, Boone, and I&#x2019;ll turn him loose.&#x2019; &#x201d; Smith saw his task as persuading the citizens and the jurors that the case was not what it appeared to be&#x2014;�that the filmmakers were not &#x201c;a bunch of privateers and pirates&#x201d; but respectable people who had been commissioned by the United States government, that the film was not another study of how poor and ignorant people were in Eastern Kentucky but a film about the whole United States in which the shots of Eastern Kentucky would take up only a few seconds, that the filmmakers had behaved properly and politely to those they were photographing. &#x201c;Why, if they had been smart alecks come to hold us up to ridicule, I&#x2019;d be the last man to try him,&#x201d; Smith assured everyone. It took Smith only a day or so to present his case against Hobart Ison, although it took three days to pick the jury. On the witness stand, the surviving filmmakers managed to avoid admitting to Ison&#x2019;s lawyers that it was the appalling poverty of his tenants that had interested them; they talked about being attracted by expressive family groups and by the convenience of not having to move their equipment far from the road. The defense asked if they were planning to take pictures of the Bluegrass as well as Appalachia. Were they going to make a lot of money from the film? How many millions of viewers would see the pictures of poor Eastern Kentucky people? Had they refused to move? Had they taunted Ison by saying he was shooting blanks?

Detective Superintendent Jeanette Kihlberg heads the investigation, battling an apathetic prosecutor and a bureaucratic police force unwilling to devote resources to solving the murder of an immigrant child. But with the discovery of the mutilated corpses of two more children, it becomes clear that a serial killer is at large. <br><br>Superintendent Kihlberg turns to therapist Sofia Zetterlund for her expertise in the psychopathology of those who kill, and the lives of the two women become quickly intertwined&#x2014;professionally and personally. As they draw closer to each other and to the truth about the killings, what surfaces is the undeniable fact that these murders are only the most obvious evidence of an insidious evil woven deep into Swedish society.</p><p><b>ERIK AXL SUND&nbsp;</b>is the pen name of Swedish author duo Jerker Eriksson and H�kan Axlander Sundquist.The house&nbsp;was over a hundred years old, and the solid stone walls were at least a meter thick, which meant that she probably didn&#x2019;t need to insulate them, but she wanted to be absolutely sure.<br><br> To the left of the living room was a small corner room that she had been using as a combination workroom and guest bedroom.<br><br> Leading off of it were a small toilet and a fair--sized closet.<br><br> The room was perfect, with its single window and nothing but the unused attic above.<br><br> No more nonchalance, no more taking anything for granted.<br><br> Nothing would be left to chance. Fate was a dangerously unreliable accomplice. Sometimes your friend, but just as often an unpredictable enemy.<br><br> The dining table and chairs ended up shoved against one wall, which opened up a large space in the middle of the living room.<br><br> Then it was just a matter of waiting.<br><br> The first sheets of polystyrene arrived at ten o&#x2019;clock, as arranged, carried in by four men. Three of them were in their fifties, but the fourth couldn&#x2019;t have been more than twenty. His head was shaved and he wore a black T--shirt with two crossed Swedish flags on the chest, under the words &#x201c;My Fatherland.&#x201d; He had tattoos of spiderwebs on his elbows, and some sort of Stone Age design on his wrists.<br><br> When she was alone again she settled onto the sofa to plan her work. She decided to start with the floor, since that was the only thing that was likely to be a problem. The old couple downstairs might&nbsp; have been almost deaf, and she herself had never heard a single sound from them over the years, but it still felt like an important detail.<br><br> She went into the bedroom.<br><br>The little boy was still sound asleep.<br><br> It had been so odd when she met him on the local train. He had simply taken her hand, stood up, and obediently gone with her, without her having to say a single word.<br><br> She had acquired the pupil she had been seeking, the child she had never been able to have.<br><br> She put her hand to his forehead; his temperature had gone down. Then she felt his pulse.<br><br> Everything was as it should be.<br><br> She had used the right dose of morphine.<br><br>The workroom had a thick, white, wall--to--wall carpet that she had always thought ugly and unhygienic, even if it was nice to walk on. But right now it was ideal for her purpose.<br><br> Using a sharp knife, she cut up the polystyrene and stuck the pieces together with a thick layer of flooring adhesive.<br><br> The strong smell soon made her feel dizzy, and she had to open the window onto the street. It was triple--glazed, and the outer pane had an extra layer of soundproofing.<br><br> Fate as a friend.<br><br> Work on the floor took all day. Every so often she would go and check on the boy.<br><br> When the whole floor was done she covered all the cracks with silver duct tape.<br><br> She spent the following three days dealing with the walls. By Friday there was just the ceiling left, and that took a bit longer because she had to glue the polystyrene first, and then wedge the blocks up against the ceiling with planks.<br><br> While the glue was drying she nailed up some old blankets in place of the doors she had removed earlier. She glued four layers of polystyrene onto the door to the living room.<br><br> She covered the only window with an old sheet. Just to be sure, she used a double layer of insulation to block the window alcove. When the room was ready, she covered the floor and walls with a waterproof tarpaulin.<br><br> There was something meditative about the work, and when at last she looked at what she had accomplished she felt a sense of pride.<br><br>The room was further refined during the following week. She bought four small rubber wheels, a hasp, ten meters of electric cable, several meters of wooden skirting, a basic light fitting, and a box of light bulbs.&nbsp;She also had a set of dumbbells, some weights, and an exercise bike -delivered.<br><br> She took all the books out of one of the bookcases in the living room, tipped it onto its side, and screwed the wheels under each corner. She attached a length of skirting board to the front to conceal the fact that it could now be moved, then placed the bookcase in front of the door to the hidden room.<br><br> She screwed the bookcase to the door and tested it.<br><br> The door glided soundlessly open on its little rubber wheels. It all worked perfectly. She attached the hasp and shut the door, concealing the simple locking mechanism with a carefully positioned lamp.<br><br> Finally she put all the books back and fetched a thin mattress from one of the two beds in the bedroom.<br><br> That evening she carried the sleeping boy into his new home.</p><h2>Axiom: Powerful Leadership Proverbs</h2><p>The best leaders not only lead well but also reflect on their leadership long enough and thoughtfully enough to articulate the philosophies that cause them to do so.

In <i>Barcelona the Great Enchantress,</i> Hughes crafts a more personal tale of his nearly forty-year love affair with the Spanish metropolis, one of the most vibrant and fascinating cities in Europe. <br><br>Beginning with a vivid description of his wedding in the splendid medieval ceremonial chamber in Barcelona's city hall, Hughes launches into a lively account of the history, art, and architecture of the storied city. He tells of architectural treasures abounding in 14th-century Barcelona, establishing it as one of Europe's great Gothic cities, while Madrid was hardly more than a cluster of huts. The city spawned such great artists as Antoni Gaudi, Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro, Salvador Dali, and Pablo Casals. Hughes's deep knowledge of the city is evident&#x2014;but it's his personal reflections of what Barcelona, its people, and its storied history and culture have meant to him over the decades that sets <i>Barcelona the Great Enchantress</i> apart from all others' books.</p><p>Robert Hughes was the long time critic for <i>Time Magazine.</i> He is the author of many books, including the best-selling <i>Fatal Shore</i> and his recent, critically acclaimed memoir <i>Things I Didn't Know,</i> as well as the originator and narrator of the highly acclaimed PBS television series <i>Shock of the New</i> and <i>American Visions.</i> A frequent contributor to <i>The New York Review of Books,</i> Hughes lives in New York City.In this pared-down version of his acclaimed Barcelona (1992), art critic Hughes traces Barcelona&#x2019;s progress from a burgeoning port city to the booming Catalan capital that roughly 1.5 million people call home today. Hughes&#x2019;s portrait chronologically flutters from one century to another, shedding light on the city&#x2019;s cryptic history in a way very few non-Catalans can. Hughes treats the city as if it&#x2019;s his own, and his critiques are justified and insightful, drawing on personal anecdotes, excerpts of Catalan manuscripts and anti-Castilian decrees. It&#x2019;s not the details of cataclysmic events like the plague of 1348 or the bitter suffocation forced upon Catalu�a by Franco that make Hughes&#x2019;s book worthwhile, but rather the accounts of small events that transformed "one enormous ashtray, covered in a mantle of grime and grit" into what is now an affable, colorful, modern hub. The author poetically weaves politics, food, architecture, sport, myths and music into a striking depiction of the great Catalan seaport. 8 b&amp;w photos, 1 map.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A must-read volume&nbsp; for students of history, sociology, law and psychology.</p><p>Gustave Le Bon (7 May 1841 &#x2013; 13 December 1931) was a French social psychologist, sociologist, and amateur physicist. He was the author of several works in which he expounded theories of national traits, racial superiority, herd behavior and crowd psychology. His work on crowd psychology became important during the first half of the twentieth century when it was used by media researchers such as Hadley Cantril and Herbert Blumer to describe the reactions of subordinate groups to media. He also contributed to controversy about the nature of matter and energy. His book The Evolution of Matter was very popular in France (having twelve editions), and though some of its ideas&#x2014;notably that all matter was inherently unstable and was constantly and slowly transforming into luminiferous ether&#x2014;were used by some physicists of the time (including Henri Poincar�), his specific formulations were not given much consideration. In 1896 he reported observing a new kind of radiation, which he termed "black light" (not the same as what modern people call black light today), though it was later discovered not to exist.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Born Again</h2><p>Twenty years ago, against the backdrop of the explosive Watergate scandal, Charles Colson revealed the story of his own search for meaning during the tumultuous investigations that led to the collapse of the Nixon administration.

The story itself is set in a place that will remind most readers of current-day Iraq. Characters (hero and villain alike) face serious moral questions like What is justice? Is a hero really a hero if he fights to stop people who are liberating their country? Is it ever right to kill? Often, readers must stop to ask themselves who the heroes really are&#x2013;and there are no concrete answers. Very few comics have created superheroes with such realistic issues. The illustrations are reminiscent of those from the DC Comics' heyday; they are dark, action packed, and full of energy (even if they do have bustier women who show a little bit more skin).<i>&#x2013;Scott La Counte, Anaheim Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In August of that year, Flo was guarding a high-level US-Afghan delegation and noticed someone suspicious: a local man stumbling toward his patrol. Flo reacted quickly and ran to tackle the man&#x2014;who was wearing a suicide vest&#x2014;before he could reach the patrol. Four people died in the subsequent explosion, but many others were spared.

By the fortieth day of Ranger School in October 2009, my lifelong dislike of hiking had turned into pure hatred.<br> <br>I had to get through only twenty-one more days to earn the Army&#x2019;s coveted Ranger tab, but after six weeks of constant fatigue, I was just about finished. Like most of my fellow soldiers, I had lost around twenty pounds due to strictly imposed food limits, and hadn&#x2019;t slept more than four hours a night since Ranger School began. For me, those challenges were nothing compared to hiking up and down Ranger Camp Frank D. Merrill&#x2019;s ruthless cliffs. The mountains of North Georgia were my kryptonite.<br> <br>On the fortieth night, my thirteen-man squad and I were on what we called a &#x201c;death march,&#x201d; which started in the dead of night and wouldn&#x2019;t end until we reached a mock objective at 0500. Thankfully it was neither too hot nor cold in early October, but an unrelenting rainstorm made my wet, muddy boots feel as if they were filled with concrete. Even with my night optical devices (NODs), I could barely see the tree branches that were constantly snapping into my face. Bugs were all over my body and inside my dry, thirsty mouth.<br> <br>I knew that these hardships were designed to prepare us for many months of combat in the mountains of Afghanistan, where I would likely deploy after Ranger School. But I was physically and mentally drained, with a stomach buckling in on itself. All I could think about was how much this sucked. My deteriorating legs and body language made it even more obvious that I was struggling.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; another Ranger candidate, Staff Sergeant Erick Gallardo, said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hell,&#x201d; I said while gasping for air. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t take this shit anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Are you falling asleep?&#x201d;<br> <br>Guys passing out during simulated missions, even while standing up or marching, was commonplace. For me, though, it was about more than sleep deprivation. I felt like forty straight days of Ranger School&#x2019;s nonstop chaos had finally broken me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m smoked, man,&#x201d; I told Gallardo. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m done.&#x201d;<br> <br>After a pause, Gallardo, who had narrowly survived a bullet striking his helmet in eastern Afghanistan&#x2019;s infamous Korengal Valley, made me an offer.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you quit right now, I&#x2019;ll quit with you,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Gallardo had received a Silver Star for his heroic actions as the leader of a 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team squad that included Army Staff Sergeant Salvatore Giunta (who would later receive the Medal of Honor). Gallardo had been through a lot worse than the mountains of North Georgia. Even though he had nearly been killed in Afghanistan, Gallardo wanted to return to the battlefield as a platoon sergeant, which required earning the Ranger tab.<br> <br>If I quit, it wouldn&#x2019;t just be a huge setback to my military career; it would mess up Gallardo&#x2019;s future, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get through this damn patrol and sleep on it,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;If you feel the same way in the morning, we&#x2019;ll quit tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gallardo gave me the second wind I needed, and out of habit my mind snapped back to a concept that had been drilled into my head since the beginning of Ranger School: leave no man behind. After getting through nearly six hellish weeks, why should I give up and take another soldier down with me? Quitting was contrary to everything I stood for.<br> <br>The next day, the sun came out for the first time in a long while.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are we quitting today?&#x201d; Gallardo inquired as we wolfed down our MREs (Meals, Ready to Eat).<br> <br>&#x201c;Negative,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>But the next night, I reached a second breaking point during another eleven-hour death march. That made our total time awake twenty-three hours. With one hour to go, I was frantically searching for a piece of lost gear, and soon realized I was hallucinating from exhaustion.<br> <br>My Ranger buddy had hurt his ankle a few meters earlier, which prompted me to grab his tripod and add it to the pile of gear that was already on my back. I was carrying over one hundred pounds, in addition to my M240 machine gun. The enormous weight, combined with the pitch-black darkness and brutal terrain, caused me to trip and fall into the mud&#x2014;fifteen separate times.<br> <br>Each time I fell, I worried that I would accidentally discharge my weapon, which would have resulted in my immediate dismissal from Ranger School. Each time I got up, it became harder and harder to lift the hundred-pound weight on my back.<br> <br>After the fifteenth fall, my backpack&#x2014;or &#x201c;ruck&#x201d; as we say in the military&#x2014;felt lighter. Either my hallucinations were worsening, I thought, or a piece of gear was missing.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s when I realized that the tripod had disappeared somewhere in the darkness, along with&#x2014;in all likelihood&#x2014;my chances of graduating from Ranger School. Like an accidental gun discharge, losing your Army equipment was a serious offense, and the Ranger Instructors (RIs) had zero sympathy for this scenario.<br> <br>For the sixteenth time, I fell down, this time out of complete mental obliteration rather than physical fatigue. The thought of fifteen months of hard work&#x2014;from US Army Basic Training, Officer Candidate School, and the Basic Officer Leadership Course to Infantry School, Airborne School, and now Ranger School&#x2014;ending in failure was devastating. Many of my peers did not think highly of an infantry officer without a Ranger tab. I had chosen to undergo what was probably the Army&#x2019;s toughest training regimen because I wanted to lead soldiers in combat, but in that moment my path to war was muddier than the ground I was lying on.<br> <br>When I looked up, I could barely make out a familiar face staring down at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get up, Groberg,&#x201d; Gallardo said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got too much fun left; you don&#x2019;t want to miss it!&#x201d;<br> <br>Ranger School challenges everything about a human being. It challenges your mind, your body, your emotions, your leadership, your decision making, and most important, your attitude. As Gallardo demonstrated while sensing my struggles, there was also nowhere to hide. From the RIs to your peers, everybody was watching.<br> <br>Eventually, I found my way to my feet and looked at Gallardo. It&#x2019;s rare to face a career decision that can clearly change the trajectory of your life, but for me this was one of those defining moments. While thinking about what to do for a few seconds, I forgot where I was.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>&#x201c;You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months,&#x201d; I said in French. &#x201c;The eyes of the world are upon you.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your task will not be an easy one,&#x201d; I continued. &#x201c;Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle hardened. He will fight savagely.&#x201d;<br> <br>Seconds later, I moved an army of little green plastic soldiers into formation. In a few moments, they would unleash a furious assault on a nearly identical army of gray plastic men.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and skill in battle,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We will accept nothing less than full victory. Good luck!&#x201d;<br> <br>I was quoting General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x2019;s famous letter to US troops before the Allied liberation of France, where I was born. As a nine-year-old boy, I was busy reenacting World War II, which I had been obsessed with since learning to read. From a young age, playing with toy soldiers inside my room in the Paris suburb of Ach�res had been my favorite activity.<br> <br>As my plastic army assaulted Normandy&#x2019;s heavily fortified shores, which were actually pillows, my voice would frequently change as I pretended to belt out commands from the respective green and gray army commanders.<br> <br>&#x201c;ATTACK,&#x201d; I shouted.<br> <br>Before long, though, D-Day was interrupted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Flo?&#x201d; my mother, Klara Groberg, said. &#x201c;Stop talking to yourself!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not talking to myself,&#x201d; I said assertively. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the soldiers!&#x201d;<br> <br>Eventually, my mom became so concerned that my pretend violence was influencing my behavior at school that she took me to a doctor. Fortunately, the family physician told her that young boys playing war was nothing to be concerned about.<br> <br>It was common culture in France to aspire to one day put on a uniform and become a soldier. In my mind, fighting the bad guys always made sense, and for as long as I could remember, I was fascinated by the concept of defeating an enemy, and in particular moving troops into position for battle. To be honest, I understood&#x2014;even at a young age&#x2014;how that could be concerning to a mother.<br> <br>Despite common dreams, my path to the US Army was different from that of most soldiers, mainly because I was born in France. As American kids grew up in the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton years, my character was primarily molded in the relatively poor suburbs of Paris between 1983 and 1994. I also lived in Spain for a short time and frequently visited Algeria, where my mother was born and raised before she moved to France and eventually met my father, Larry Groberg.<br> <br>My mom first took me to Algeria when I was three months old. I was the grandparents&#x2019; first grandchild (albeit my mom has eleven siblings), and I had nearly died in the hospital after being born three months premature. Therefore, my mom bringing me to North Africa, where she had grown up during the brutal Algerian War in the 1950s, was a monumental moment for my family.<br> <br>My uncle, Abd Alillah Lahreche (who went by Abdou), was ecstatic upon my early arrival. To this day, my mom, the eldest sibling, can vividly recall handing me over to her younger brother.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am your Uncle Abdou,&#x201d; he said in Arabic while staring straight into my little eyes. &#x201c;You are my Flo.&#x201d;<br> <br>Even though he had no experience caring for children, let alone babies when he was only eighteen years old, Uncle Abdou treated me as if I were his own son. On that very first day, he held me on his chest for several hours while I took a nice, long nap.<br> <br>Quickly, Uncle Abdou became that one person that all young children cling to. He took his role as a guardian as seriously as his name, which means &#x201c;servant of God&#x201d; in Arabic.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are my Flo,&#x201d; he repeated. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t let anything happen to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Starting in my preschool years, I would regularly visit my grandparents, aunts, and uncles in Algeria, but my connection to Uncle Abdou became so strong that even when my mom and I would make unannounced visits, my uncle had already told other family members about my impending arrival. We always joked that Uncle Abdou knew when I was coming to visit because of the unwavering bond we shared.<br> <br>Abdou also made it a priority to visit my family in France during a week-long gap between the start of French and Algerian schools. On the day of his arrival, I would sit atop the steps leading to my family&#x2019;s apartment and wait for my idol. Regardless of whether my wait lasted minutes or hours, I was always nervous that he wouldn&#x2019;t appear. I wouldn&#x2019;t eat, drink, or play with my toy soldiers until I saw him open the front door.<br> <br>After Uncle Abdou would arrive and give me a hug and kiss on the forehead, without fail he would say &#x201c;You are my Flo&#x201d;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. every single time.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are my Abdou,&#x201d; I would respond.<br> <br>Over dinners that were more like feasts, I overheard stories about the horrors of the war in Algeria. Uncle Abdou didn&#x2019;t have a military background, but he still managed to impart crucial values about good and evil to me throughout those dinners. My uncle also taught me that liberty wasn&#x2019;t granted to all.<br> <br>&#x201c;Freedom has to be earned,&#x201d; Uncle Abdou said. &#x201c;Sometimes, you have to fight for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>My uncle was a devout Muslim. My mom grew up in the same household and was brought up the same way, but I was not raised Muslim. Instead I followed my father&#x2019;s Lutheran faith.<br> <br>Despite my Christian upbringing, my parents still encouraged me to attend the mosque with Uncle Abdou, where I would watch him carry out Islam&#x2019;s most sacred traditions. It took only one visit for me to develop enormous respect for my uncle&#x2019;s authentic commitment to his faith.<br> <br>By the time my family moved across the Atlantic to the Chicago suburb of Palatine, Illinois, when I was twelve, a radical Islamist organization known as GIA&#x2014;or Groupe Islamique Arm� in French&#x2014;was causing mass chaos as it terrorized innocent Algerian men, women, and children beginning in 1992.<br> <br>As I heard about what was happening in Algeria while I was struggling to adapt in an unfamiliar country, I also learned that my uncle&#x2019;s lesson about freedom was not empty rhetoric. After watching in horror as fellow Algerians were murdered, raped, and dismembered, Uncle Abdou swore an oath to fight terrorism as a soldier in the Algerian army.<br> <br>My mom didn&#x2019;t tell me until later, but when he joined the military, my uncle told her that he wasn&#x2019;t afraid of dying for his country. He was, however, deeply fearful of being tortured by the ruthless GIA terrorists, whose crimes against humanity were similar to the present-day barbarism of the Islamic State, or ISIS.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to die the right way,&#x201d; Uncle Abdou told my mom.<br> <br>Even though I was still a boy, my uncle&#x2019;s courage was deeply inspirational. Not only was Uncle Abdou like a big brother; he had fulfilled my personal dream of becoming a soldier.<br> <br>Shortly after my twelfth birthday, we moved from the Chicago area to the Washington, D.C., suburb of Bethesda, Maryland. My English was getting better, but still needed a lot of work. Just as in Illinois, the combination of ESL (English as a Second Language) classes and competitive sports probably did the most to speed my adaptation. Still, America was new and different. Adjusting was not easy.<br> <br>It was an exciting, bustling time to be an American teenager as the economy boomed and the country prepared to host the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, but when you don&#x2019;t know much English, you feel like an outsider. Learning a new language was the biggest challenge of my youth, so I attacked it with the same vigor as in those mock D-Day invasions. While we spoke French inside our new home in Maryland, my mom and dad had a strict rule: as soon as we stepped out the front door, we spoke only English.<br> <br>I realized my English had improved a great deal when I began to watch and understand classic war movies in English, without subtitles. I don&#x2019;t suppose most people think of the early Rambo films and Platoon being tools for teaching a language, but that&#x2019;s exactly what those movies did for me.<br> <br>I tried to keep in touch with Uncle Abdou, but it became difficult with him fighting the GIA on Algeria&#x2019;s front lines. When we had last spoken a few months earlier, on Christmas Eve, he had told me that while war is terrible and scary, he knew that fighting evil was the right thing to do. Even though I was an easily distracted teenager who didn&#x2019;t fully understand how much danger my uncle was facing, he was a constant source of inspiration.<br> <br>As Uncle Abdou and the Algerian army fought halfway around the world in February 1996, I went on a school trip to a Smithsonian museum with my classmates. When I returned to Bethesda, I noticed that my mom wasn&#x2019;t there, which was very unusual for our regular routine. I asked my dad where she was, and he said that I would be able to talk to her soon.

What happens afterwards is a testament to the power of a woman&#x2019;s love and determination, and to the invisible line of hope and healing that connects one human being with another. Ultimately, in the hands of Anna Quindlen&#x2019;s mesmerizing prose, <b>Every Last One</b> is a novel about facing every last one of the the things we fear most, about finding ways to navigate a road we never intended to travel, to live a life we never dreamed we&#x2019;d have to live but must be brave enough to try.<br></p><p><b>An Interview with Author Anna Quindlen</b> <br> <p> <b>Q:</b> <i>Every Last One</i> is arguably your darkest novel since <i>Black and Blue</i> in 1998. What made you want to write about tragedy striking an ordinary family? Or was it a theme that first intrigued you? </p><p></p> <b>A:</b> For a long time I've been thinking about illusions of security and control, especially in terms of motherhood. We think that if we do the right things, provide the right kind of care and oversight, we can keep our children safe from any perils. I suspect that's at the heart of the epidemic of so-called helicopter parenting we see today. But it's completely illusory. Sure, you can teach your teenager to drive carefully, but what difference does that make when a drunk driver roars through a stop sign? That sense of randomness, of the contrast between the care that parenthood requires and the dangers lurking in the world, sometimes right under our noses, is what I chose to explore here. I also wanted to illuminate the ways in which small events in our lives can combine to create unexpected results. I tried to make that clear through a combination of the details that make up the bedrock of a happy family life, and the occasional suggestion that the bedrock had cracks within it. It required a kind of subtlety and control that I haven't needed quite so much in my other novels. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> What is it like to write about the devastating events like those encountered by the characters in <i>Every Last One</i>? Was your day to day experience of writing this novel different from your last novel, <i>Rise and Shine</i>? What was the biggest challenge for you, in writing <i>Every Last One</i>? <p></p> <b>A:</b> I think everyone assumes I was in a funk during the creation of this novel, but it just wasn&#x2019;t so. The explanation for that lies, I think, in the narrator, Mary Beth Latham. My experience as a novelist--this is my sixth--is that once you&#x2019;ve nailed your protagonist, those around her come to life. And at some level she becomes your reason for being. I resonated with Mary Beth right away, felt that I knew her, which of course was critical since the book is written in the first person and is really her story. Most of the challenges were about how to make her real. It&#x2019;s hard to write a novel about motherhood without creating either a plaster saint or a punching bag. I&#x2019;m sick and tired of both those ways of looking at the very difficult, joyful and complicated task on which I&#x2019;ve personally been laboring for the last quarter-century. Mary Beth is an ordinary woman, involved and distracted and smart and unaware, all of those things that simultaneously make up human behavior. That&#x2019;s what I was after. And it&#x2019;s what made me able to live in the world of this book, because I was living on her shoulder. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> Motherhood is a central theme of many of your books. Why do you think the subject has held your interest, over the years? <p></p> <b>A:</b> I once wrote that reading makes us feel less alone. It&#x2019;s why I love it so. But writing, if we touch a chord in others, can make both the writer and readers feel less alone, feel connected to others like themselves. My life experience, and thus my work, is often a reflection of being female in America. And while we&#x2019;ve expanded expectations and opportunities enormously over my lifetime, there is still a kind of unique loneliness to childrearing for women. We so often do it in isolation. Add to that the fact that in our competitive, perfectionist culture, in which the price women are required to pay for freedom still seems to be martyrdom, almost everyone lies about motherhood. Part of that lying is loyalty--I can&#x2019;t let on that my kid is the only one on the playground who can&#x2019;t read or play the piano--and part of it is self-protection, since we&#x2019;ve made hyper motherhood a measure of female success. The preferred answer to the question &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; is always &#x201c;Fine&#x201d;, and the answer to the question &#x201c;How are the kids?&#x201d; is supposed to be &#x201c;Great!&#x201d; That&#x2019;s true even if the accurate answers would be &#x201c;terrible&#x201d; and &#x201c;a mess.&#x201d; I think that produces its own kind of desperation, especially for women, who yearn to be emotionally open. Thank God for good girlfriends. That&#x2019;s a theme in this book as well. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> <i>Every Last One</i> raises many questions about parenting--when to micromanage, when to punish, and when to let go. In your opinion, is Mary Beth a good mother? <p></p> <b>A:</b> I think Mary Beth is a wonderful mother, sensitive, attentive and loving. But the whole point of this book is that sometimes that&#x2019;s not enough. There are a million moving parts to raising kids, and you can&#x2019;t always anticipate them all, especially when the outside world, other people, play such a huge role in their lives as they grow older. With independence there is one kind of pitfall; with overprotection, there is another. And sometimes you do everything right and something bad just happens. It&#x2019;s as simple, and as scary, as that. <p></p> Of course, when things go wrong, it&#x2019;s still the mother who gets blamed. Where was she? What was she thinking? I wanted to look at that phenomenon in this novel, too. I&#x2019;ve been distressed at how many people immediately concluded that Mary Beth was at fault in the events of the book. But I wasn&#x2019;t surprised. Despite the increased role of fathers in our society, there&#x2019;s still a sense that motherhood is the big fail if anything goes wrong. Yet it&#x2019;s independence that is the ultimate success for your kids. If your goal is to build strong people from the ground up, the only way to do that is to give them enough rope to sometimes make their own mistakes. That&#x2019;s a big theme in the novel, balancing oversight and independence <p></p> I do think this sort of oversight is more frequently the purview of women. I used to say that my editorial direction on &#x201c;Life in the 30s&#x201d; was to write about what my friends and I were discussing on the phone. And then I would add, &#x201c;If my husband had to write a column based on his phone calls...&#x201d; I never got to finish that sentence. Every woman in the audience would bust up. It was assumed that women were in the business of emotional deconstruction, and men weren&#x2019;t. Sometimes it means that we&#x2019;re more engaged in certain aspects of our children&#x2019;s lives. Sometimes it means, as Glen says of Mary Beth in <i>Every Last One</i>, that we&#x2019;re way over involved. <p></p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: An Essay by Anna Quindlen</strong> <br> <p>The best preparation I could have had for a life as a novelist was life as a newspaper reporter. At a time when more impressionistic renderings of events were beginning to creep into the news pages, I learned to look always for the telling detail: the neon sign in the club window, the striped towel on the deserted beach. I learned to distinguish between those details that simply existed and those that revealed. Those telling details are the essence of fiction that feels real. The command of those details explains why Charles Dickens, a onetime reporter, has a byline for the ages.</p> <p>I learned, from decades of writing down their words verbatim in notebooks, how real people talk. I learned that syntax and rhythm were almost as individual as a fingerprint, and that one quotation, precisely transcribed and intentionally untidied, could delineate a character in a way that pages of exposition never could. And I learned to make every word count. All those years of being given 1,200 words, of having the 1,200 pared to 900 at 3 o'clock: it teaches you to make the distinction between what is necessary and what is simply you in love with the sound of your own voice. The most important thing I ever do from an editing perspective is cut. I learned how to do that in newsrooms, where cutting is commonplace, swift, and draconian.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s where I learned about writer's block, too. People have writer's block not because they can't write, but because they despair of writing eloquently. That's not the way it works, and one of the best places to learn that is a newspaper, which in its instant obsolescence is infinitely forgiving. Jacques Barzun once wrote: "Convince yourself that you are working in clay, not marble, on paper, not eternal bronze: let that first sentence be as stupid as it wishes. No one will rush out and print it as it stands." Journalism is the professional embodiment of that soothing sentiment.</p> <p>Of course, it is also the professional embodiment of fact-finding, and that, more than anything else, is why the notion of a journalist who is also a novelist perplexes readers. "I could never make it up," one of the very best reporters I've ever known said to me. But that notion of untrammeled invention becomes illusory after a while. If you manage to build characters from the ground up carefully, make them really real, your ability to invent decreases as their verisimilitude grows. Certain people will only behave in certain ways; certain behaviors will only lead to certain other behaviors. The entire range of possible events decreases as characters choose one road, not another. Plot is like a perspective drawing, its possible permutations growing narrower and narrower, until it reaches a fixed point in the distance. That point is the ending. Life is like that. Fiction is like life, at least if it is good. And I know life. I learned it as a newspaper reporter, and now I reflect that education as a novelist. <em>--Anna Quindlen</em></p>Anna Quindlen is the author of five bestselling novels (<b>Rise and Shine, Blessings, Object Lessons, One True Thing, Black and Blue</b>), and six nonfiction books (<b>Being Perfect, Loud &amp; Clear, A Short Guide to a Happy Life, Living Out Loud, Thinking Out Loud, How Reading Changed My Life</b>).

It is divided into 35 chapters, one for each day of the week over a seven week period. Each chapter is about 15 pages long, enough for a new player to read and absorb in a day. Thus, at the end of 35 days or 5 weeks, the reader should be a competent bridge player. This book describes the Standard American bidding system. Although still the most widely known system, there have been a proliferation of bidding systems. The reader should be prepared to play under other systems. The reader should be aware that this book primarily describes Rubber Bridge play. Nowadays, most bridge play is duplicate. In spite of these developments, this book remains the one more players start off with than any other book. Thus, it should be required reading for all bridge players. If offers the clearest and most easy-to-read description of bridge.</p><p>Alfred Sheinwold was born on January 26, 1912. He was an American bridge player, administrator, international team captain and prolific author of books about bridge. He was, with Edgar Kaplan, co-developer of the Kaplan-Sheinwold bidding system. Among other administrative assignments that he accepted, Sheinwold chaired the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) National Laws Commission from 1964 to 1975, and the ACBL Appeals Committee from 1966 to 1970. He also was the Editor of the ACBL Bulletin from 1952 to 1958. Sheinwold was born in London, England and emigrated to the United States as a young man. He soon became well known as a bridge writer and editor, and started work as an editor for Ely Culbertson's magazine, The Bridge World, in 1934, where he held the posts of technical editor, then managing editor, and then senior editor. After Edgar Kaplan purchased The Bridge World, Sheinwold became one of four expert members on the rotating directorship of the Master Solvers Club, from 1967&#x2013;1980. During WWII, Sheinwold interrupted his bridge career to serve as Chief Code and Cipher Expert in the Office of Strategic Services for the United States. During the period of the development of the Kaplan-Sheinwold bidding system, Sheinwold was particularly successful in national level tournament bridge in the United States. He won the Chicago event (subsequently known as the Reisinger) in 1958 and the Spring National Men's Teams in 1964, was on the runner-up team for the Vanderbilt (also 1958), and had many regional wins. Sheinwold was often sought as captain by US teams that were pursuing national and international championships. He captained the 1985 US team that won the Bermuda Bowl, and also the 1975 US team that placed second in the same event. Sheinwold is best known for his syndicated newspaper column, which ran for more than 30 years. He also prepared the AutoBridge hands and discussions, and authored Five Weeks to Winning Bridge, which has sold more than a million copies. He was principal author of The Kaplan-Sheinwold System of Winning Bridge, the first extended description of the Kaplan-Sheinwold bidding system. Sheinwold's smooth, encouraging writing style made him the most popular bridge author of his time. Sheinwold died of a heart attack in Sherman Oaks, California on March 8, 1997 at the age of 85.</p><h2>Indian Boyhood</h2><p><i>Indian Boyhood</i> (1902) was the literary debut of Charles A. Eastman (Ohiyesa), a Santee Sioux whose eleven books aimed at bringing whites and Indians closer together. The favorable reception of the autobiographical Indian Boyhood would lead him to write such classic works as <i>Old Indian Days</i> (1907), <i>Wig warn Evenings: Sioux Folk Tales Retold</i> (with Elaine Goodale Eastman, 1909), <i>The Soul of the Indian</i> (1911), <i>From the Deep Woods to Civilization</i> (1916), and <i>Indian Heroes and Great Chieftains</i> (1918), all reprinted as Bison Books. <p>At the beginning of <i>Indian Boyhood</i> Eastman recalls the 1862 Sioux Uprising in Minnesota that sent his family into exile in Canada.

I have also felt a need to dispel some rather major misconceptions, the main one being the fact that Hindu astrology is extraordinarily difficult. This is not true, as will soon hopefully be revealed. Although I have always been most fascinated with astrology because of the philosophical implications and revelations which can be extracted. I have done my best to keep philosophy from this work, as that is not my present purpose. It is my intention only to present Hindu astrology in a way that it deserves to be presented, which is long overdue -- a way which western astrologers can understand and utilise, and which will clear away the mystery and finally put into perspective the enormously complex techniques which make up the bulk of most textbooks on the subject. Having worked with both Hindu and western systems, it is my experience that the two greatly complement each other and together form the basis for a complete and profound astrology.&#34; -- taken from the Introduction.</p><p>James Braha</p><h2>The Functioning Transcendent: A Study in Analytical Psychology</h2><p>The Transcendent is a reality that functions in all our lives all the time, whether you call it God, the unkown, or the holy.

Searing and brutally honest, <b>Night Dogs</b> plunges us into the free-fire zones of our cities, where the legendary thin blue line is breaking down.<br><br>The North Precinct of Portland, Oregon, is home to two kinds of cops: sergeants and lieutenants who've screwed up somewhere else, and patrolmen who thrive on the action on the Avenue. Officer Hanson is the second kind, a veteran who has traded his Bronze Star for a badge. War is what Hanson knows, and in this battle for Portland's meanest streets, he's fighting not so much for the law as for his own code of justice.<br><br>Hanson is a man who seems to fear nothing--except his own memories.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is his past that could destroy him now:&nbsp;&nbsp;An enemy in the department is determined to bring him down by digging into his war record and resurrecting the darkest agonies of that nightmare time.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hanson himself risks everything--his career, his equilibrium, even his life--when the only other survivor of his Special Forces unit comes back into his life. Doc Dawson is a drug dealer and a killer...but he's the one man Hanson can trust.<br><br>Night Dogs is an extraordinary work from a powerful and authentic voice in American fiction. Recoiling from the violence that Hanson deals with every day, the violence that is in Hanson, readers will also understand the compassion that drives him.&nbsp;&nbsp;A novel remarkable for its razor-sharp characterizations and dialogue, its freshness of observation, <b>Night Dogs</b>--and Hanson--will remain etched in the memory for a long time to come.</p><p>"Every June 15th out at North Precinct, 'A' relief and graveyard shift started killing dogs. The police brass and local politicians only smiled if they were asked about it, shook their heads, and said it was just another one of those old myths about the precinct. The cops at North Precinct called them 'Night Dogs,' feral dogs, wild and half-wild, who roamed the districts after dark. Their ancestors had been pets, beaten and abandoned by their owners to breed and give birth on the streets." That's the stately, carefully weighted language and metaphor that begins what James Crumley (<i>The Last Good Kiss</i>) calls "the best cop novel I have ever read." Of course, the "night dogs" are not only the roaming canines but also the people from the rougher neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon--most particularly the police who work out of North Precinct. Seen through the eyes of a patrolman named Hanson, a Vietnam vet who thought he had seen the worst the world had to offer over there but is proved wrong every day, the story at first seems episodic, unconnected. But gradually all the threads of anger and pain come together to create an unforgettable picture of urban angst. Author Kent Anderson, who was a Vietnam vet and a Portland policeman in the 1970s, says that some readers might find his book disturbing or offensive: "The truth sometimes affects people that way." Then he adds a chilling footnote: "Things are much worse now than they were in 1975."Praise for Kent Anderson's <i>Night Dogs</i>:<p>"The best cop novel I have ever read.

Some of these states came remarkably close to joining the Union. Others never had a chance. Many are still trying. Consider:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �&nbsp; Frontier legend Daniel Boone once proposed a state of Transylvania in the Appalachian<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wilderness (his plan was resurrected a few years later with the new name of Kentucky).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �&nbsp; Residents of bucolic South Jersey wanted to secede from their urban north Jersey<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neighbors and form the fifty-first state.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �&nbsp; The Gold Rush territory of Nataqua could have made a fine state&#x2014;but since no women<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were willing to live there, the settlers gave up and joined California.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each story offers a fascinating glimpse at the nation we might have become&#x2014;along with plenty of absurd characters, bureaucratic red tape, and political gamesmanship. Accompanying these tales are beautifully rendered maps detailing the proposed state boundaries, plus images of real-life artifacts and ephemera.

Accompanying a full-scale exhibition on Lautner at Los Angeles&#x2019;s Hammer Museum, this is the first publication to comprehensively explore his work, including his apprenticeship with Frank Lloyd Wright and the cultural and geographical context of Los Angeles, through an intensive examination of the archives of the John Lautner Foundation. Although Lautner&#x2019;s dramatic houses are well-known, this is the first time his work has been seriously examined by scholars. Historian Nicholas Olsberg contributes an analysis of Lautner&#x2019;s evolution, providing social and cultural context. Architect Frank Escher covers the relationship between his experiments in structure and poetics of space, and Jean-Louis Cohen discusses Lautner&#x2019;s place in new design tendencies.This richly illustrated monograph includes previously unpublished sketches, drawings, construction images, and Lautner&#x2019;s own photographs to unveil the evolution, originality, and logic of his designs, focusing on the atmospheres and vistas they establish and the connections to landscape and sensory fluidity that mark their innovative spatial arguments.</p><p>Nicholas Olsberg is the former director of the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal. Jean-Louis Cohen is the Sheldon H. Solow Professor in the History of Architecture at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University. Frank Escher is a principal in the architecture firm Escher GuneWardena. In 1994, he worked with John Lautner to produce the architect&#x2019;s monograph."The authors succeed not only in communicating why Lautner was important, but why his explorations of form and structure were inevitable, given the vast postwar changes in society...beautifully illustrated and laid out..." ~<i>Modernism</i><br><br>"This prized volume is more than a mere "beauty book." While marveling at how gorgeous sweeping concrete can be, one is also afforded how it can be, with a look at detailed drawings showing the workings of the architect....a presentation of the compelling ideas, intentions, and inventions behind Lautner's heavenly designs." ~<i>Society of Archiectural Historians News</i></p><h2>The Ukimwi Road: From Kenya to Zimbabwe</h2><p>A record of the author&#39;s three-thousand-mile trip by mountain bike through sub-Saharan Africa describes the landscape and village life of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and other countries, and the impact of AIDS, drought, and economic mismanagement there.</p><p>Dervla Murphy has written more than twenty books recounting her adventures all over the world on foot, mule, bicycle, and just about every other conveyance imaginable. Her books Full Tilt, Eight Feet in the Andes, The Waiting Land, Muddling Through in Madagascar, On a Shoestring to Coorg, Cameroon with Egbert, Transylvannia and Beyond, The Ukimwi Road, and South from the Limpopo are available from The Overlook Press.A brave and thoughtful Irishwoman, 60-ish Murphy (Transylvania and Beyond) specializes in treks through remote regions. Here she recounts a 3000-mile, four-month bicycle ride through southern Africa, at first seeking a ``carefree ramble'' but soon learning that most of her planned route included the region's ukimwi (AIDS) belt. Thus, Murphy's travelogue, which mixes her reflections on colonial legacies with well-etched encounters with border bureaucrats and generous locals, is shadowed by the specter of loss: a young prostitute, her siblings' sole support after their parents died of AIDS, struggles to make her clients use condoms; an expat doctor agonizes over the dilemmas of notifying the HIV-positive. Given her encounters with troubled Africans as well as her views of ineffective Western aid workers, Murphy concludes-a bit simplistically-that it's time for the West to withdraw, to leave Africans ``to sort out their own future.'' Despite that, this book-first published in the U.K. in 1993-remains resonant. <p></p><p>Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Recipe for Treason: A Lady Arianna Regency Mystery (Lady Arianna Hadley Mystery)</h2><p><b>A diabolical traitor who's always out of reach...</b><br><br>England, 1814.

Because history&#x2014;ecological, cultural, even personal&#x2014;flavors every bite we eat. Whether it&#x2019;s the volatile chemical compounds that a plant absorbs from the soil or the stories and memories of places that are evoked by taste, layers of flavor await those willing to delve into the roots of real food. In this landmark book, Gary Paul Nabhan takes us on a personal trip into the southwestern borderlands to discover the terroir&#x2014;the &#x201c;taste of the place&#x201d;&#x2014;that makes this desert so delicious.</p><p>To savor the terroir of the borderlands, Nabhan presents a cornucopia of local foods&#x2014;Mexican oregano, mesquite-flour tortillas, grass-fed beef, the popular Mexican dessert <em>capirotada</em>, and corvina (croaker or drum fish) among them&#x2014;as well as food experiences that range from the foraging of Cabeza de Vaca and his shipwrecked companions to a modern-day camping expedition on the Rio Grande. Nabhan explores everything from the biochemical agents that create taste in these foods to their history and dispersion around the world. Through his field adventures and humorous stories, we learn why Mexican oregano is most potent when gathered at the most arid margins of its range&#x2014;and why foods found in the remote regions of the borderlands have surprising connections to foods found by his ancestors in the deserts of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. By the end of his movable feast, Nabhan convinces us that the roots of this fascinating terroir must be anchored in our imaginations as well as in our shifting soils.</p></p><p>Gary Paul Nabhan is an internationally celebrated desert explorer, plant hunter, and storyteller of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, as well as a pioneer in the local foods movement. Nabhan is author or editor of twenty-four books, including Chasing Chiles: Hot Spots Along the Pepper Trail, The Desert Smells Like Rain, and Coming Home to Eat. This book reunites him with Paul Mirocha, the illustrator and co-conspirator of their award-winning Gathering the Desert. Nabhan has received a MacArthur &#x201c;genius&#x201d; fellowship and the Vavilov Medal, and he currently holds an endowed chair in sustainable food systems at the University of Arizona. At his home near the Mexican border, he tends an orchard of heirloom fruits and heritage crops."One of Napa Valley&#x2019;s most prestigious winemakers recently said that there is no such thing as terroir. He scoffed at the idea... that wine somehow captures the essence of place. A scientist by training, he insisted instead that wine is the result of chemical processes that can be analysed and controlled, nothing more. Gary Paul Nabhan&#x2019;s new book, Desert Terroir: Exploring the unique flavors and sundry places of the borderlands, is an eloquent refutation of that assertion. Like other proponents of terroir, Nabhan argues that sunlight, wind, rain and minerals in the soil all affect the way a given food tastes. But for him there is more. Terroir is also an expression of the hands of the women who rhythmically pat out tortillas in the borderlands between the United States and Mexico, and of the labours of ranch hands who graze sturdy Corriente cattle. It is found, too, in the ancestry of both human and plants. If we attune ourselves to our own history, and to that of the natural world, we stand to gain a keen appreciation for our planet&#x2019;s myriad distinctive tastes... Nabhan is a natural storyteller."

Except for the infant she nursed, she was alone, enjoying the clean evening air, air swept of sand grit and dust by the unseasonal afternoon rain. So clear was the silver-green sky that the still-sunlit Aerlal Plateau stood out above the nearer treeless rise that was Westridge, stood out so forcefully that it appeared yards away rather than tens of vingts to the north and east.<br>She rocked slowly, looking down at her nursing son, a child already with dark hair, more like deep gray than black. Through the open windows set in the heavy stone walls, she could hear the occasional clatter of platters being replaced in the cupboards, and the squeak of the hand pump.<br>The glittering and scattered light reflected from the quartz outcroppings on the top edge of the distant and towering plateau died away as the sun dropped farther. Before long, pinlights that were stars appeared, as did the small greenish crescent that was the moon Asterta. The larger moon, Selena, had already set in the west.<br>She brought the infant to her shoulder and burped him. &#x201c;There...there, that&#x2019;s a good boy, Alucius.&#x201d; Then she resettled herself and offered the other breast.<br>As she began to rock once more, a point of light appeared off the north end of the porch, expanding into a winged feminine figure with iridescent green-tinged silver wings. The nursing mother blinked, then turned her head slowly. For several moments, she looked at the soarer, a graceful feminine figure somewhere in size between an eight-year-old girl and a small young woman--except for the spread wings of coruscating and shimmering light, which fanned yards out from the soarer&#x2019;s body until it bathed both mother and infant.<br>The woman chanted softly,<br>* * *<br>&#x201c;Soarer fair, soarer bright,<br>only soarer in the night<br>wish I may, wish I might<br>have this wish I wish tonight...&#x201d;<br>* * *<br>For a long moment after she had completed her wish, the woman watched. The soarer&#x2019;s wings sparkled, their movement seemingly effortless, as she hung in midair, in turn watching mother and child, less than twenty yards from the pair on the porch. As suddenly as she had appeared, the soarer was gone, as was the green radiance that had emanated from her.<br>Slowly, the woman murmured the old child&#x2019;s rhyme to herself.<br>* * *<br>&#x201c;Londi&#x2019;s child is fair of face.<br>Duadi&#x2019;s child knows his place.<br>Tridi&#x2019;s child is wise in years,<br>but Quattri&#x2019;s must conquer fears.<br>Quinti&#x2019;s daughter will prove strong,<br>while Sexdi&#x2019;s knows right from wrong.<br>Septi&#x2019;s child is free and giving,<br>but Octdi&#x2019;s will work hard in living.<br>Novdi&#x2019;s child must watch for woe,<br>while Decdi&#x2019;s child has far to go.<br><br>But the soarer&#x2019;s child praise the most,<br>for he will rout the sanders&#x2019; host,<br>and raise the lost banners high<br>under the green and silver sky.&#x201d;<br>* * *<br>She looked beyond the north end of the porch once more, but there was no sign that the soarer had ever been there.<br>Within moments, the door to the house opened, and a lean man stepped outside, moving near-silently toward the woman in the rocking chair. &#x201c;I thought I saw a light-torch out here. Did someone ride up?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No...&#x201d; She shifted the infant and added, &#x201c;There was a soarer here, Ellus.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A soarer?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She was out there, just beyond where you put the snow fence last winter. She hovered there and looked at us, and then she left.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you sure, Lucenda?&#x201d; Ellus&#x2019;s voice was gentle, but not quite believing.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m quite sure. I don&#x2019;t imagine what&#x2019;s not there.&#x201d;<br>Ellus laughed, warmly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve learned that.&#x201d; After a moment, he added, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re supposed to be good luck for an infant.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know.

This book, by a senior politician who has spent significant periods of time in her company, and is also a distinguished historian, portrays her more credibly than any other yet published.</p><p><b>Douglas Hurd</b> is a politician, biographer, and novelist who served in the governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, as Minister for Europe (1979-83), Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (1984-85), Home Secretary (1985-89) and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1989-95). His previous books include <i>Robert Peel: A Biography</i> and<i> Choose Your Weapons.</i></p><h2>Edwurd Fudwupper Fibbed Big</h2><p>Edwurd Fudwupper spends all his time cooking up big fibs. But one day, he tells such a humdinger that the army, the air force and the dog catcher are called to try to reverse the damage wrought. An unlikely heroine comes to his rescue.</p><p>Berkeley Breathed ("Bloom County") continues his successful second life as a first-rate children's storyteller. In the spirit of <i>A Wish for Wings That Work</i> and <i>Red Ranger Came Calling</i>, <i>Edwurd Fudwupper Fibbed Big</i> celebrates Breathed's ample cartooning skill while incorporating a more weighty, atmospheric style to tell a simple story that makes intelligent use of both. Energetic, silly, "Bloom County"-esque caricatures provide contrast to some truly impressive set pieces, fat with color and playfully composed. And that's just the illustrations.<p> Edwurd's hilarious story is told by his overlooked little sister Fannie: "From a long line of liars, there's none higher upper... / Than my fibbing big brother, / The Edward Fudwupper." This accomplished yarn-spinner just can't seem to stop himself, "like the time he fibbed big / And told Ben and Dinky / That I had been borne by / A poodle named Stinky." But after an accident in the den with Mom's porcelain pig, Edwurd goes too far and implicates a couple of "passionate porkers" from Pluto. Soon the military arrives in full force, "with planes and with tanks and with loud whirligigs!" (Not to mention a very serious-looking helicopter with a banner encouraging the frightened populace below to "STAY CALM.") But this proves to be the least of Edwurd's worries, and in the end it's up to brave Fannie to save the day with a fib of her very own. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>"Berkeley Breathed, one of America's most popular illustrators, has won a Pulitzer Prize for his editorial cartooning. His comic strip "Bloom County" ran for years in newspapers around the world, and his books of the collected cartoons include the bestsellers 'Toons for Our Times and Penguin Dreams and Stranger Things. His highly acclaimed picture books, A Wish for Wings That Work, The Last Basselope, Goodnight, Opus, and Red Ranger Came Calling, have been hits with children and adults alike. <p>Berkeley Breathed lives, surfs, and collects vintage ray guns with his wife, Jody, in southern California."</p></p><h2>Memorable Days: The Selected Letters of James Salter and Robert Phelps</h2><p>James Salter had written two novels, <i>The Hunters</i> and <i>The Arm of Flesh</i>, but it was his third, remarkable novel <i>A Sport and a Pastime</i>, together with his film <i>Three</i> and a script he had written for <i>Downhill Racer</i>, that in 1969 elicited a letter of admiration from a writer and critic he did not know&#x2014;Robert Phelps. The correspondence that resulted went on to span two decades. The letters themselves are exceptionally alive, uninhibited, gossipy, touching, and brilliant. The successes of Salter and the struggles of Phelps are fully explored by the writers themselves in an honest exchange only letters can divulge. Along with an insightful foreword by Michael Dirda, this book gives voice to a nearly forgotten figure and his friendship with a man he admired.</p><p>Authors Salter and Phelps reveal their undying friendship and intense connection in this well-edited collection of 20 years of their correspondence. After the release of Salter's film Three, Phelps wrote him a letter conveying his appreciation for many of his works. A relationship immediately bloomed. In letters the two men mention family matters often, but in a matter-of-fact manner; real displays of emotion were saved for addressing each another, as though each were the most important person in the other's life. They discuss hardships and challenges within their personal and professional lives (expressing concern over writing for personal vs. monetary gain, for instance). It's apparent that both men lived their lives for the thrill of art and writing, but also greatly enjoyed having a partner with whom they were able to intimately discuss their passions and dreams. More than friends and less than lovers, Salter and Phelps were literary soul mates. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

How do strong confessional churches that seem to be doing all the right things drift inexorably from the truth?. What is clear from Ian Hamilton's fascinating study is that it doesn't happen over night but it is a gradual erosion of theological and doctrinal standards.<br>Nineteenth century Scotland was seen as a Christian nation composed of church-going people. Among its churches, Presbyterianism was strongest, and within Presbyterianism there were several large denominations. The future looked bright and optimism marked many of the church leaders and congregations. Yet the sad fact is that most of them were blind to the presence of the warning signs that ultimately caused the decline and not the continued growth of the church in Scotland. <br>To understand how this happened Ian Hamilton looks at the changes that took place within one of these large Presbyterian denominations - the United Presbyterian Church - and analyses the roots, developments and consequences of these changes, particularly the departure from the doctrines summarised in the Westminster Confession of Faith. It is a salutary lesson to observe that the movements for church unions and increased evangelism of the nineteenth century were not signs of spiritual health; instead they were inadequate sticking plasters that hid dangerous spiritual disease. This book also includes discussion on the nature of subscription to the Confession at time of 1733 secession, the atonement controversy 1841-45, the Union controversy 1863-1873 and 1879 United Presbyterian Church Declaratory Act.</p></p><p>Ian Hamilton has been the minister of Cambridge Presbyterian Church since 1999. Prior to that he served as minister of Loudoun Church of Scotland, Newmilns. He serves on the Board of The Banner of Truth Trust.What strikes me most about this revised edition is its relevance to our situation today and Pastor Hamilton's careful research, scholarly precision, and warm style make the book very useful to the scholar and accessible to the ordinary reader. (Joseph A. Pipa, Jr. ~ President, Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, Greenville, South Carolina)<br><br><i>The Erosion of Calvinist Orthodoxy</i> is an invaluable historical case study of the fascinating and complex issues of Christian orthodoxy. In it Ian Hamilton carefully traces the arguments and positions which eventually fed into the theological liberalism of the 19th and 20th centuries that has left the church moribund.But perhaps the chief value of Ian Hamilton's work is the sobering message it carries for the contemporary church, where some views regarded as new and ground-breaking bear an uncanny resemblance to those that once led to the spiritual wasteland. Ignorance of the past often leads to the repetition of its mistakes. Ian Hamilton here provides an important historical antidote for such theological amnesia. (Sinclair B. Ferguson ~ Associate Preacher, St Peter's Free Church, Dundee, Scotland)<br><br>In an era where the drive in some quarters to watering down confessional commitment precisely as a means of strengthening orthodoxy seems almost irresistible, Ian Hamilton's study of nineteenth century Scottish Presbyterianism is a timely reminder: revisions of confessions and terms of subscription have often proved to be anything but friendly towards a robust Christianity, a point made here with scholarly grace and theological acumen. It is good to see this book back in print and made available to a wider audience. (Carl R. Trueman ~ Paul Woolley Professor of Historical Theology and Church History, Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)<br><br>Ian Hamilton's <i>The Erosion of Calvinist Orthodoxy</i> is the seminal modern study of confessional subscription in the Scottish tradition. His recounting of the story, and his conclusions, are of direct relevance, not only to Presbyterians, but to all who are committed to confessional fidelity in the great evangelical Protestant tradition. Any further study of this important topic must reckon with Hamilton's account and findings.

In his twenties he became a conspicuous society figure, frequenting the most fashionable Paris salons of the day. After 1899, however, his suffering from chronic asthma, the death of his parents and his growing disillusionment with humanity caused him to lead an increasingly retired life. He slept by day and worked by night, writing letters and devoting himself to the completion of A la recherche du temps perdu.

Bereft of a mother, she is comforted by her six brothers who love and protect her. Sorcha is the light in their lives, they are determined that she know only contentment.</p><p>But Sorcha's joy is shattered when her father is bewitched by his new wife, an evil enchantress who binds her brothers with a terrible spell, a spell which only Sorcha can lift--by staying silent. If she speaks before she completes the quest set to her by the Fair Folk and their queen, the Lady of the Forest, she will lose her brothers forever. </p><p>When Sorcha is kidnapped by the enemies of Sevenwaters and taken to a foreign land, she is torn between the desire to save her beloved brothers, and a love that comes only once. Sorcha despairs at ever being able to complete her task, but the magic of the Fair Folk knows no boundaries, and love is the strongest magic of them all...</p></p><p>At the heart of this surprisingly accomplished first novel, first book of the Sevenwaters trilogy, is a retelling of an ancient Celtic legend. Marillier's story, however, is much more than a slightly disguised fairy tale. Young Sorcha is the seventh child and only daughter of Irish Lord Colum of Sevenwaters, a domain well protected from invading Saxons and Britons by dense forest where, legend says, fey Deirdre, the Lady of the Forest, walks the woodland paths at night. Colum is first and foremost a warrior, bent on maintaining his lands against all outsiders. Not all of his sons are so bound to the old ways, and that family friction leads to outright disobedience when Sorcha and her brother Finbar help a Briton captive escape from Colum's dungeon. Soon after, Colum brings home a new wife who ensorcels everyone she can't otherwise manipulate. By her spell Sorcha's brothers are cursed to become swans. Only Sorcha, hiding deep in the forest, can break the spell by painfully weaving shirts of starwort nettle--but then Sorcha is captured by Britons and taken away across the sea. Determined to break the curse despite her captivity, Sorcha continues to work, little expecting that ultimately she will have to chose between saving her brothers and protecting the Briton lord who has defended her throughout her trials. Marillier's writing is deft and heartfelt, bypassing the usual bombast of fantasy fireworks for a rich, magical story of loyalty and love. <i>--Charlene Brusso</i><p><b>Juliet Marillier</b> was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, a town with strong Scottish roots.

He lives in London, England.Playing with archetype, myth and the nature of reality, Holdstock returns to the landscape of his World Fantasy Award-winning Mythago Wood , a primeval woodland in modern England that has defended itself through the eons with mythagos, embodiments of the human need for heroes and heroic acts. Devastated by the death of his young son, Alexander, Richard Bradley meets Alexander Lytton and Helen Silverlock, who indicate that the boy is still alive in a mysterious way in nearby Ryhope Wood. As the distraught father follows researcher Arnauld Lacan into the wood, he is gradually introduced to its properties and inhabitants, which range through the deeply embedded myths of all times. Meanwhile, Lytton wants Bradley to find Alexander because the fearful boy's vivid fantasies are changing the very nature of the wood that Lytton and his crew have been studying for years. Bradley's search proves unsuccessful, however, and it's only after the father gains the aid of Sarin, the Tall Grass Lady from the time of the Tower of Babel, that his quest reaches its climax. Holdstock weaves a dense and, at times, impenetrable tale, but a careful reading brings to light a variety of treasures, including a telling portrayal of Jason and the Argonauts in old age. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Pereira Maintains</h2><p>In the sweltering summer of 1938 in Portugal, a country under the fascist shadow of Spain, a mysterious young man arrives at the doorstep of Dr Pereira.

A political history of 1930s Portugal, a love story between a man and his dead wife, a gloriously successful formal experiment, and an irresistible thriller - and it can be read with enormous pleasure in a single afternoon. -- Mohsin Hamid Pereira Maintains is small only in size. Its themes are great ones - courage, betrayal, fidelity, love, corruption; and its treatment of them is subtle, skilful, and clear. It's so clear, in fact, that you can see a very long way down, into the heart of a flawed but valiant human being, into the sickness of a nation, into the depths of political evil. It's the most impressive novel I've read for years, and one of the very few that feels truly necessary. -- Philip Pullman Close to being a perfect novel - brief, tragic, inspiring -- John Carey, Chairman of the International Man Booker 2002 Pereira is a marvelously complex creation. One of the most intriguing and appealing character studies in recent European fiction. * * Kirkus Reviews * * Every word of Mohsin Hamid's introduction is true: it's a stunningly good novel, and it goes on getting better in one's head after one has stopped reading it - it works as an experience - something that has happened to one, which is of course, the proof of great writing. -- Diana Athill It grips from start to finish....a riveting political allegory * * Financial Times * * Tabucchi writes...with an agility of mind and an economy of narrative that pulls the reader along * * Observer * * Political but gorgeously artful, sad and then laugh out loud funny, pacy as a thriller ....This book is perfectly executed * * Dazed and Confused * * This novel...has been sensitively and intelligently translated revealing this understated masterpiece of love and courage. * * Good Book Guide * * [A] succinct, deceptively low-key political thriller...it's brilliant and you'll go on thinking about the characters and the way it's written for weeks. -- Sue Arnold * * Guardian * * Concise, intense and striking. * * Daily Telegraph * * Seemingly plain at first, the story becomes gripping as soon as you realize that the beauty of Tabucchi's narrative lies in between the lines, making the novel a thought-provoking and delightful read. -- Maria-Christina Marchi * * Time Out * * A powerfully concise story of heroism versus acquiescence which gains eloquence from its simplicity * * Sunday Telegraph * * Tabucchi's book (widely interpreted as a critique of Berlusconi) niggles away at the ambiguous space between aggrieved resistance and passive inaction * * Guardian * * In its quiet, brilliant way, this is a novel you will read carefully. It is subtle and powerful; it deserves to be a classic. * * Scotsman * * A moving intellectual thriller * * London Magazine * * subtle and powerful; it deserves to be a classic -- William Leith * * The Scotsman * * gripping * * Baby &amp; Me * * A masterpiece . . . Romantic, devastating, thrilling and formally inventive -- Mohsin Hamid * * Esquire Magazine * * At once a thrilling mystery, a literary inquiry, and a meditation on politics and fascism, this novel about an overweight journalist in 1930s Portugal amazed me with its compression and use of the testimonial form.

His four books cover a wide range of moods and topics: friendship is the dominant theme of about a third of the poems; a great many deal with love and amorous situations, often amusingly; others deal with patriotic and political themes. The seventeen epodes, which Horace called iambi, were also inspired by a Greek model: the seventh century iambic poetry of Archilochus. As in the odes, love and politics are frequent themes; some of the epodes also display mockery and ridicule, of a harsher variety than we find in Horace's satires. </p></p><p></p><h2>Glencoe The Story Of The Massacre</h2><p>'You are hereby ordered to fall upon the rebels, the MacDonalds of Glencoe, and to put all to the sword under seventy.'

The completion of the fragmentary score by his assistant Franz Xaver S�ssmayr, who helped him with The Magic Flute, has the character of a historical source with utmost closeness to Mozarts thoughts. The completed Requiem score, published in the New Mozart Edition, serves as the basis for this vocal score edition which now appears in a revised form and newly engraved. Minor corrections have been made to the musical text, the vocal parts have been made easier to read and the piano accompaniment easier to play. Christoph Wolff, an authoritative Requiem connoisseur has supplied a Foreword with a clear and concise account of the works genesis and its musical features. The vocal score has been newly engraved with a generous layout. The pagination has been adopted from the previous edition. This means that you can rehearse and perform this work with some singers using this new edition and some the old B�renreiter edition. This new vocal score includes a revised piano reduction: The old Moehn piano reduction has been maintained, but corrected and uncluttered; on the whole the new piano reduction is easier to read and to play. The vocal score is fully compatible with all existing performance material (BA 4538). A more exact spacing of underlaid words has been included in the vocal parts. The text appears in a slightly larger type size.

The program has been used with measurable success in many settings. It can be adapted to the specific setting and needs of the participants. After an introduction explaining the principles on which the program is based, a detailed step-by-step training format is presented. The six group experiences, called stages, center on the following themes: racism, definitions and inconsistencies; confronting the reality of racism; dealing with feelings; cultural differences; exploring cultural racism, the meaning of whiteness; individual racism; and developing action strategies. Instructions and suggestions for conducting each session are provided, along with recommended readings, lists of materials required, and sources of materials."

Filled with allusions to literature and art, as well as to the absurdities and delights of the everyday world around us, Ashbery&#x2019;s poems are haunting, surprising, hilarious, and knowing all at once, the work of a master craftsman with a keen understanding of the age in which he lives and writes, an age whose fears and fragmentation he conjures and critiques with humor, pathos, and a provocative wit.</p><p>Vital and imaginative, Ashbery&#x2019;s poems not only touch on the &#x201c;big questions&#x201d; and crises of life in the twenty-first century, but also delicately capture the small moments between and among people.

Here can be traced the development of his thought, particularly his increasingly precise articulation of the nature and method of liturgical theology. Here too can be found Schmemann&#39;s constant stress on liturgy as an eschatological and ecclesial event. He repeated challenges the liturgical movement in both East and West to rediscover this understanding of the liturgy, an understanding which was so central in the life of the early church. The introduction by Thomas Fisch discusses Schmemann&#39;s contribution to the broader liturgical movement and places him in the vanguard of twentieth century thinkers.</p><p>Father Alexander Schmemann ( 1983) was a prolific writer, brilliant lecturer, and dedicated pastor. Former dean and professor of liturgical theology at St Vladimir&#39;s Orthodox Theological Seminary, his insight into contemporary culture and liturgical celebration left an indelible mark on the Christian community worldwide.</p><h2>The Last Straw</h2><p>Winter squabbling in the McDonald household turns to a true celebration of the Christmas spirit when Mother revives an old holiday custom of doing favors in secret for other family members.</p><p></p><h2>Folksy Favorites (Leisure Arts #3391)</h2><p>You won&#39;t want to miss this collection of seven of Pat Sloan&#39;s quilt and wall hanging patterns, including &#34;Basket of Hope,&#34; a heart-touching design she created in the days following September 11, 2001.</p><p></p><h2>Forever Yes: Art of the New Tattoo</h2><p>Forever Yes &#34;Art Of The New Tattoo&#34; is a hardcover book featuring over 80 full color photographs and an introduction from legendary tattooer Don Ed Hardy</p><p></p><h2>Eight Feet in the Andes: Travels with a Donkey from Ecuador to Cuzco (Traveller&#39;s)</h2><p>The author describes a journey she made through the Peruvian Andes with her nine-year-old daughter and a mule, and shares her observations on the people of Peru</p><p>Dervla Murphy is one of the very best loved of travel writers. She was born in County Waterford and since 1964 has been regularly publishing accounts of her journeys - by bicycle and on foot - in the remoter areas of four continents. She has also written about the problems of Northern Ireland, the hazards of nuclear power, and race relations in Britain. The Times Literary Supplement called her &#39;an admirable woman - she has a romantic soul and a keen eye&#39;.Armchair travelers should take note of Dervla Murphy&#39;s trek through the Andes with her nine-year-old daughter. Binchy gives a creditable reading if one excuses minor stumbling and infrequent background noise. Murphy&#39;s story is occasionally interrupted by accounts from her daughter, which, unfor-tunately, reveal Binchy&#39;s difficulty with the child&#39;s characterization. Nonetheless, the story is a wonderful blend of feminism, anthropology and adventure. The set should appeal to many, both lovers of fiction and nonfiction. E.L.C.

Waves crash upon the rocks or wash up on beautiful stretches of sandy beaches. This is the location of The Sea Ranch, an area covering several thousand acres of large, open meadows and forested natural settings interspersed with award-winning architecture. When the area, a sheep ranch well into the last century, was rediscovered for its beauty in the 1960s, it came to be envisioned as a home community that harmonized with the environment. <br>Renowned landscape designer Lawrence Halprin's master plan for The Sea Ranch community accordingly incorporated a set of building guidelines that minimized the visual as well as physical impact upon the landscape. Subsequent buildings by architects such as Joseph Esherick, Charles Moore, William Turnbull, Obie Bowman, Donlyn Lyndon, and others have been recognized worldwide for environmentally sensitive planning and architecture. They sparked a generation of imitators that became part of what is known as "The Sea Ranch style," epitomizing what many people imagine when they think of Northern Californian architecture. <br>This beautiful monograph, lavishly illustrated with over 300 newly commissioned photographs and including maps, plans, detailed descriptions of the houses, and essays by Donald Canty and Lawrence Halprin, presents the definitive record of The Sea Ranch community.</p><p>Donlyn Lyndon was one of the founding partners of MLTW. Lyndon has been recognized as one of the foremost educators in the country, receiving the Topaz Award in 1997 from the AIA.

Fitzmyer's <i>The Acts of the Apostles</i> is indispensable. Beginning with the Ascension of Christ into heaven, and ending with Paul proclaiming the kingdom of God from a prison in Rome, this New Testament narrative picks up where the Gospel of Luke left off. The Acts of the Apostles is indeed a journey of nearly epic proportions--and one that requires a guide as adept as Fitzmyer.<br><br>Since Acts was most likely written by the same person who composed the Gospel of Luke, it is only fitting that the Anchor Bible Commentaries on these New Testament books should be written by the same author.

The plat du jour was 'gibelotte, pommes mousseline'- rabbit and white wine fricassee with mashed potatoes. The gibelotte was all right, the mashed potatoes the best I had ever eaten, pushed through a sieve, buttered and moistened with enough of their hot cooking water to bring them to a supple, not quite pourable consistency&#x2013;no milk, no cream, no beating. I had never dreamt of mashing potatoes without milk and, in Iowa, everyone believed that, the more you beat them, the better they were.&#x201d; <br> This book is a long-awaited story of the man who brought the simplicity of French cooking to the United States, and a statement about one of the finest and most important food professionals in the world.<br>Richard Olney, one of the first food writers to introduce the simple joys of French cooking to American readers was an American who lived in Europe for almost 50 years.

Why is it impossible to get a foot on the property ladder? How does the Mafia make money from laundries when street gangs pushing drugs don&#39;t? Who really benefits from immigration? How can China, in just fifty years, go from the world&#39;s worst famine to one of the greatest economic revolutions of all time, lifting a million people out of poverty a month? Looking at familiar situations in unfamiliar ways, THE UNDERCOVER ECONOMIST is a fresh explanation of the fundamental principles of the modern economy, illuminated by examples from the streets of London to the booming skyscrapers of Shanghai to the sleepy canals of Bruges. Leaving behind textbook jargon and equations, Tim Harford will reveal the games of signals and negotiations, contests of strength and battles of wit that drive not only the economy at large but the everyday choices we make.</p><p>"The Undercover Economist is a rare specimen: a book on economics that will enthrall its readers. Beautifully written and argued, it brings the power of economics to life. This book should be required reading for every elected official, business leader, and university student." --Steven D. Levitt, author of Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything <p>"Harford writes like a dream--and is also one of the leading economic thinkers of his generation. From his book I found out why there's a Starbucks on every corner, what Bob Geldof needs to learn to make development aid work properly, and how not to get duped in an auction. Reading The Undercover Economist is like spending an ordinary day wearing X-ray goggles." --David Bodanis, author of E=mc2 and Electric Universe </p><p>"If you need to be convinced of the ever-relevant and fascinating nature of economics, read this insightful and witty book by Tim Harford. Using one interesting example after another, The Undercover Economist demonstrates how economic reasoning -- often esoteric and dull, but totally accessible in Harford's hands -- helps illuminate the world around us. Indeed, Harford's book is a tour de force." --Jagdish Bhagwati, author of In Defense of Globalization </p><p>"As Tim Harford demonstrates brilliantly in this enjoyable book, the powerful underlying ideas of economics can, in the hands of the right person, illuminate every aspect of the world we inhabit." --Martin Wolf, Associate Editor and Chief Economics Commentator, Financial Times, and author of Why Globalization Works </p><p>"Most people think economists are boring, opinionated and wrong. Tim Harford is often right, always opinionated, but never boring. He shows how economics can be used to illuminate our everyday lives. Whether you want an explanation of the price of a cup of coffee or of poverty in the third world, Harford has it all." --John Kay, author of Culture and Prosperity: The Truth About Markets</p>Tim Harford is an editorial writer at the<i> Financial Times</i>, where he also writes the newspaper&#x2019;s &#x201c;Dear Economist&#x201d; column and &#x201c;The Undercover Economist&#x201d; column, which also appears in Slate.

Reprint.</p><p>Sharyn McCrumb is the author of several bestselling novels, including The Rosewood Casket, She Walks These Hills, and The Ballad of Frankie Silver, which was nominated for a Southeast Booksellers Association award. She has received awards for Outstanding Contribution to Appalachian Literature and Southern Writer of the Year. Her books have been named notable books of the year by both The New York Times and Los Angeles Times. She lives in Virginia.This book chronicles the role of song in the oral tradition of Appalachia as it follows a young boy kidnapped by a sailing ship in the mid-1700s--from the Scottish isles to a community in New Jersey and to the mountains of North Carolina. The use of two narrators helps the listener keep track of the various strands of the tale. James Daniels portrays various male narrators and characters, and Aasne Vigesaa portrays a number of female narrators and characters. As described in the afterword, the story is grounded in the history the author discovered while researching her family's roots. Appalachian-style dulcimer music is used for transitions between tapes.

E. MODESITT, JR. is the bestselling author of more than seventy novels encompassing two science fiction series, the Ghost Books and the Ecolitan Matter, and four fantasy series, the Imager Portfolio, the Saga of Recluce, the Spellsong Cycle and the Corean Chronicles. He lives in Cedar City, Utah.1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>In the cool air of early spring, on the second Solayi in Maris, the man who wore the uniform of a Telaryn commander stood at the foot of the long stone pier that dominated the south end of the harbor at Kephria. Behind Quaeryt were only ashes and ruins, except for the old stone fort to the immediate south of the pier, and the rising trooper compound more than a mille to the north, situated at the corner of the old fortifications that had once marked the border between Antiago and Bovaria. He looked out onto the Gulf of Khellor, where patches of mist drifted above the dark surface. <br>Then his eyes dropped to the pier, once the pride of the port city that had been leveled by the late Autarch&#x2019;s cannon and imagers. Most of the stone pillars that supported the pier remained solid&#x2014;but not all. The stone-paved surface of the long pier was pitted, and many of the gray paving stones were cracked. A few were shattered. Almost every stone showed signs of fire, either in the ashes in the mortared joins between the stones, or in blackened sections of stone. The wooden bollards were all charred&#x2014;those that remained. One section of the pier, some two hundred yards out from the shore, sagged almost half a yard over a twenty-yard stretch. <br>The <i>Zephyr</i>&#x2014;the large three-masted schooner that had brought Quaeryt, his imagers, and first company to Kephria&#x2014;lay anchored a good half mille out from the pier in the now-quiet waters of the Gulf of Kephria. <br>Quaeryt took a slow deep breath, then concentrated on the section of the pier where it joined the harbor boulevard to the first charred bollards, roughly fifty yards away. <br>The briefest flash of light flared across the first section of the pier, and then the gray stone was shrouded in a white and cold fog that drifted seaward with the slightest hint of a land breeze. When the afterimage of the flash subsided, and the fog had dispersed enough for Quaeryt to see, he smiled. He hadn&#x2019;t even felt any strain, and the first fifty yards of the stone pier looked&#x2014;and were&#x2014;as strong and as new as when they had been first constructed, centuries before. <br>He waited a bit for the frost on the gray stone to melt away, then walked carefully to the end of the section he had rebuilt with his imaging. Once there, he concentrated once again, on the next section of the pier. After the second imaging, he did feel a slight twinge across his forehead. Rather than immediately press on, given the length of the pier requiring rebuilding, Quaeryt lifted the water bottle from his jacket pocket, uncorked it, and took a swallow of the watered lager before recorking the bottle and replacing it in his pocket. <br>&#x201c;Take your time. You&#x2019;ve got all day if you need it.&#x201d; He glanced toward the fort where Vaelora was&#x2014;he hoped&#x2014;taking her time in preparing for the day. He tried not to dwell on the events that had caused her to miscarry their daughter&nbsp;&#x2026; but he had seen the darkness behind Vaelora&#x2019;s eyes when she&#x2019;d thought he wasn&#x2019;t looking. <br>Then he walked slowly to the end of the second rebuilt section, trying not to think about how much of the pier remained to be reconstructed, a good four hundred yards more extending out into the waters where the River Laar and the Gulf of Khellor met and mixed. He glanced to the west where he could barely make out through the morning mist the low smudge of land that had once held Ephra, before the Autarch&#x2019;s imagers and cannon had destroyed it. <br>Finally, he concentrated once more, and another section of the pier was renewed. Quaeryt took a slow deep breath. There had been another twinge as he&#x2019;d imaged, but it hadn&#x2019;t felt any worse than the last one. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to keep taking it slow and easy,&#x201d; he murmured as he took another small swallow of watered lager and waited for the mist and frost to clear. <br>Section by section, over the next three glasses, Quaeryt imaged and rebuilt fifty-yard lengths, although his skull ached slightly more with each effort, and he had to rest longer after each section was completed. <br>After he had finished the last section, and he walked to the seaward end of the pier, Quaeryt took a deep breath and massaged his forehead. His head definitely ached, and faint flashes of light flickered before his eyes, a sign that&#x2014;unless he wanted to be laid up and unable to image for days&#x2014;he was close to his limit for imaging. <i>For now&nbsp;&#x2026; for now. But if you don&#x2019;t keep working to build up your strength, it won&#x2019;t be there when you need it.</i> And he had no doubts he would need it on the return trip to Variana, and most likely even more after he reached the capital city of Bovaria, a land totally defeated, yet, almost paradoxically, far from conquered and certainly a land with more problems, the nastiest of which would likely fall to him&#x2014;and Vaelora&#x2014;to resolve. <br>Standing almost at the end of the pier, Quaeryt gestured, then called, image-projecting his voice toward the <i>Zephyr</i> so that Captain Sario could bring the ship back to the pier to tie up. The quick jab across his skull was a definite reminder that he needed to do no more imaging for some time. <br>He hoped he&#x2019;d recover in a few glasses, but&nbsp;&#x2026; he&#x2019;d have to see. Part of the reason he&#x2019;d worked on the pier was to determine what he could do and how fast he would recover after all his injuries in the battle for Liantiago. <br>While he waited for the schooner to raise enough sail for headway into the pier, Quaeryt lifted the water bottle from his jacket pocket, uncorked it, and took another swallow of the watered lager before recorking the bottle and replacing it. <br>Almost half a glass later, the <i>Zephyr</i> came to rest at the most seaward position at the pier, with the crew making the schooner fast to the pier, and then doubling up the lines. <br>Sario looked from his position on the sterncastle to the pier, and then to Quaeryt. &#x201c;Is it solid?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Come onto the pier and see for yourself.&#x201d; <br>After a moment the Antiagon merchant captain walked forward to midships, then made his way down the gangway that two seamen had extended. Sario stamped his boots on the stone. <br>&#x201c;Solid enough, but it was before. It still could be an illusion.&#x201d; His words held the heavy accent of Antiagon Bovarian, almost a separate dialect, and one that Quaeryt still had to strain to understand. <br>Quaeryt almost said that he didn&#x2019;t do illusions, except that he had. &#x201c;Run your fingers over the stone or the bollard there. There wasn&#x2019;t one here before. It had rotted out.&#x201d; <br>The dark-haired captain did so, then walked another few yards toward the foot of the pier and tried again. Finally, he straightened and walked back to Quaeryt, shaking his head. &#x201c;Why do you not do more like this, instead of destroying men and ships?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because there are few indeed of us, and our greatest value to a ruler is what creates and supports his power. Without the support of a ruler, imagers are killed one by one. That is because few have great power. You saw how my undercaptains collapsed after less than a glass of battle. So we support Lord Bhayar because he has supported us and has pledged to continue to do so. That is the only way in which imagers and their wives and children will ever survive in Lydar&nbsp;&#x2026; or anywhere on Terahnar.&#x201d; The reality was far more complex than that, but Quaeryt wasn&#x2019;t about to go into a long explanation. Instead, he smiled and gestured at the reconstructed pier. &#x201c;So Kephria has a good pier for ships like the <i>Zephyr.</i> Your family might do well to open a small factorage here before others come to understand that Kephria will now serve as the port for both southern Bovaria and northern Antiago.&#x201d; <br>Sario laughed. &#x201c;Commander, you have a way of making your point.&#x201d; His face sobered. &#x201c;Yet&nbsp;&#x2026; I can see the possible truth in what you say. I will talk it over with the others when I return to Westisle.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to make a stop in Liantiago to drop off several of my troopers with dispatches.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can do that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d appreciate it.&#x201d; Quaeryt nodded. &#x201c;You should be able to leave by the end of the week. I&#x2019;ve put out word to the towns inland that you have some space for cargo.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That would be welcome.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We do what we can, Captain.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s your lady, sir?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s much better. Much better, but she needs a few more days before she&#x2019;ll be up to a long ride.&#x201d; <br>Sario offered a sympathetic smile. <br>Quaeryt wished he could offer comfort in return, knowing that the captain had lost his beloved wife some years earlier, and still missed her greatly. <i>You were fortunate that you didn&#x2019;t lose Vaelora to the mistakes you made.</i> But they had lost more than either had intended. &#x201c;Until later, Captain.&#x201d; <br>Sario nodded as Quaeryt turned and walked back toward the foot of the pier&nbsp;&#x2026; and the fort. His head still throbbed, but the pain had been far worse many times before&#x2014;and he had redone the pier without tariffing the other imagers, who had more than enough to do in dealing with rebuilding the trooper compound from the ruins. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by L.

Janet died in 1994.What could be more appropriate? The Jolly Postman (1986)- -cycling past ``the fast-eloping dish and spoon,'' a giant beanstalk, and King Cole's castle--delivers holiday letters and gifts addressed to ``Mr. H. Dumpty, Wincey Ward, Cock Robin Memorial Hospital''; the Gingerbread boy; and even ``Mister Wolf,'' found ``wolfing pies and sherry'' and sporting amiably with three pigs and the little red hen. All is reported in deft, jovial verse; six bound-in envelopes contain amusing missives- -cards, a picture puzzle (Humpty Dumpty, of course), a tiny pamphlet of a book, a picture letter (Granny's sound advice to R. Hood), and--for the postman--an accordion-style peep show. The illustrations are as charming as the text--even the postmarks are fun. Pure delight.

The great Latin epigrammist's twelve subsequent books capture the spirit of Roman life in vivid detail. Fortune hunters and busybodies, orators and lawyers, schoolmasters and acrobats, doctors and plagiarists, beautiful slaves and generous hosts populate his witty verses. We glimpse here the theater, public games, life in the countryside, banquets, lions in the amphitheater, the eruption of Vesuvius. Martial's epigrams are sometimes obscene, sometimes affectionate and amusing, and always pointed. Like his contemporary Statius, though, Martial shamelessly flatters his patron Domitian, one of Rome's worst-reputed emperors.</p><p>Shackleton Bailey's translation of Martial's often difficult Latin eliminates many misunderstandings in previous versions. The text is mainly that of his highly praised Teubner edition of 1990 ("greatly superior to its predecessors," R. G. M. Nisbet wrote in <i>Classical Review</i>).</p><p>These volumes replace the earlier Loeb edition with translation by Walter C. A. Ker (1919).</p></p><p>Martial, the father of the epigram, was one of the brilliant provincial poets who made their literary mark on first-century Rome. His Epigrams can be affectionate or cruel, elegiac or playful; they target every element of Roman society, from slaves to schoolmasters to, above all, the aristocratic elite. With wit and wisdom, Martial evokes not &#34;the grandeur that was Rome,&#34; but rather the timeless themes of urban life and society.<p>D. R. Shackleton Bailey was Pope Professor of Latin Language and Literature at Harvard University.</p></p><h2>First to Fight (Starfist, Book 1)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Hard to put down . . .

During the five years before he died, Collins grew particularly close to Kitty Kienan of Grandard in County Longford. Harry Boland also expressed warm affection for Kitty in several letters, but it was the relationship between Michael and Kitty that developed and they planned to marry. They exchanged more than 300 letters which revealed not only their intimacy, but also the extraordinary pressure under which Collins lived during the tempestuous days of 1921 when the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty were being hammered out. A sequence of letters from London in May 1922 shows him near the breaking point. Kitty's letters in turn are full of concern about the life of strain Michael is forced to live and its looming physical danger. Both of them wish for a normal life in marriage.<br><br>This new and splendidly designed edition contains, for the first time, facsimile reproductions of the letters and includes correspondence first discovered in 1994. It is being published to coincide with the release of a major motion picture on Michael Collins, wirtten and directed by Neil Jordan, starring Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts and based upon the relationship between Michael and Kitty.<br></p><p><b>Lion O Broin</b> was a distringuished writer, broadcaster, historian and public servent. He died in 1990.<br><br><b>CIan O Heigeartaigh</b> is a journalist and television producer.<br>Collins (1890-1922) is remembered as the man who outfoxed the British in the Irish War of Independence, led the hard-nosed negotiations that resulted in the eventual establishment of the Irish Republic and became head of state at the age of 31. This book looks at him in a startling new light. We don't see Collins the brutal revolutionary, but rather the man in love as he conducted the affairs of an embryo nation. This volume contains 315 letters between Collins and his fiancee, Kitty Kiernan, a hotel keeper from County Longford. It shows him in a very human state: as one of the most important men in Ireland, he apologizes for not writing because "I had no stamps." We find that Collins attended daily mass during the treaty negotiations in 1921, always lighting a candle for Kiernan; we see him so exhausted that he was always thinking of getting some sleep; and we learn that he allowed Kiernan to call him "Ducky"?probably the most innocuous sobriquet ever bestowed upon him. The late O Broin, a historian, and O hEigeartaigh, a journalist and TV producer, show Collins as a very humble, earnest man, with only the best interests at heart for both Kiernan and the Irish state. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Live and Let Die</h2><p>sexy art 2002 UK edition paperback new condition.

THE RED CARPET</b></p> <p>There are moments of great luxury in the life of a secret agent. There are assignments on which he is required to act the part of a very rich man; occasions when he takes refuge in good living to efface the memory of danger and the shadow of death; and times when, as was now the case, he is a guest in the territory of an allied Secret Service.</p> <p>From the moment the BOAC Stratocruiser taxied up to the International Air Terminal at Idlewild, James Bond was treated like royalty.</p> <p>When he left the aircraft with the other passengers he had resigned himself to the notorious purgatory of the US Health, Immigration and Customs machinery. At least an hour, he thought, of overheated, drab-green rooms smelling of last year's air and stale sweat and guilt and the fear that hangs round all frontiers, fear of those closed doors marked PRIVATE that hide the careful men, the files, the teleprinters chattering urgently to Washington, to the Bureau of Narcotics, Counter Espionage, the Treasury, the FBI.</p> <p>As he walked across the tarmac in the bitter January wind he saw his own name going over the network: BOND, JAMES. BRITISH DIPLOMATIC PASSPORT 0094567, the short wait and the replies coming back on the different machines: NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE. And then, from the FBI: POSITIVE AWAIT CHECK. There would be some hasty traffic on the FBI circuit with the Central Intelligence Agency and then: FBI TO IDLEWILD: BOND OKAY OKAY, and the bland official out front would hand him back his passport with a 'Hope you enjoy your stay, Mr Bond.'</p> <p>Bond shrugged his shoulders and followed the other passengers through the wire fence towards the door marked US HEALTH SERVICE.</p> <p>In his case it was only a boring routine, of course, but he disliked the idea of his dossier being in the possession of any foreign power. Anonymity was the chief tool of his trade. Every thread of his real identity that went on record in any file diminished his value and, ultimately, was a threat to his life. Here in America, where they knew all about him, he felt like a negro whose shadow has been stolen by the witch-doctor. A vital part of himself was in pawn, in the hands of others. Friends, of course, in this instance, but still . . .</p> <p>'Mr Bond?'</p> <p>A pleasant-looking nondescript man in plain clothes had stepped forward from the shadow of the Health Service building.</p> <p>'My name's Halloran. Pleased to meet you!'</p> <p>They shook hands.</p> <p>'Hope you had a pleasant trip. Would you follow me, please?'</p> <p>He turned to the officer of the Airport police on guard at the door.</p> <p>'Okay, Sergeant.' 'Okay, Mr Halloran. Be seeing you.'</p> <p>The other passengers had passed inside. Halloran turned to the left, away from the building. Another policeman held open a small gate in the high boundary fence.</p> <p>'Bye, Mr Halloran.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Bye, Officer. Thanks.'</p> <p>Directly outside a black Buick waited, its engine sighing quietly. They climbed in. Bond's two light suitcases were in front next to the driver. Bond couldn't imagine how they had been extracted so quickly from the mound of passengers' luggage he had seen only minutes before being trolleyed over to Customs.</p> <p>'Okay, Grady. Let's go.'</p> <p>Bond sank back luxuriously as the big limousine surged forward, slipping quickly into top through the Dynaflow gears.</p> <p>He turned to Halloran.</p> <p>'Well, that's certainly one of the reddest carpets I've ever seen. I expected to be at least an hour getting through Immigration. Who laid it on? I'm not used to VIP treatment. Anyway, thanks very much for your part in it all.'</p> <p>'You're very welcome, Mr Bond.' Halloran smiled and offered him a cigarette from a fresh pack of Luckies. 'We want to make your stay comfortable. Anything you want, just say so and it's yours. You've got some good friends in Washington. I don't myself know why you're here but it seems the authorities are keen that you should be a privileged guest of the Government. It's my job to see you get to your hotel as quickly and as comfortably as possible and then I'll hand over and be on my way. May I have your passport a moment, please.'</p> <p>Bond gave it to him. Halloran opened a briefcase on the seat beside him and took out a heavy metal stamp. He turned the pages of Bond's passport until he came to the US Visa, stamped it, scribbled his signature over the dark blue circle of the Department of Justice cypher and gave it back to him. Then he took out his pocket-book and extracted a thick white envelope which he gave to Bond.</p> <p>'There's a thousand dollars in there, Mr Bond.' He held up his hand as Bond started to speak. 'And it's Communist money we took in the Schmidt-Kinaski haul. We're using it back at them and you are asked to co-operate and spend this in any way you like on your present assignment. I am advised that it will be considered a very unfriendly act if you refuse. Let's please say no more about it and,' he added, as Bond continued to hold the envelope dubiously in his hand, 'I am also to say that the disposal of this money through your hands has the knowledge and approval of your own Chief.'</p> <p>Bond eyed him narrowly and then grinned. He put the envelope away in his notecase.</p> <p>'All right,' he said. 'And thanks. I'll try and spend it where it does most harm. I'm glad to have some working capital. It's certainly good to know it's been provided by the opposition.'</p> <p>'Fine,' said Halloran; 'and now, if you'll forgive me, I'll just write up my notes for the report I'll have to put in. Have to remember to get a letter of thanks sent to Immigration and Customs and so forth for their co-operation. Routine.'</p> <p>'Go ahead,' said Bond. He was glad to keep silent and gaze out at his first sight of America since the war. It was no waste of time to start picking up the American idiom again: the advertisements, the new car models and the prices of second-hand ones in the used-car lots; the exotic pungency of the road signs: SOFT SHOULDERS - SHARP CURVES - SQUEEZE AHEAD - SLIPPERY WHEN WET; the standard of driving; the number of women at the wheel, their menfolk docilely beside them; the men's clothes; the way the women were doing their hair; the Civil Defence warnings: IN CASE OF ENEMY ATTACK - KEEP MOVING - GET OFF BRIDGE; the thick rash of television aerials and the impact of TV on hoardings and shop windows; the occasional helicopter; the public appeals for cancer and polio funds: THE MARCH OF DIMES - all the small, fleeting impressions that were as important to his trade as are broken bark and bent twigs to the trapper in the jungle.</p> <p>The driver chose the Triborough Bridge and they soared across the breath-taking span into the heart of uptown Manhattan, the beautiful prospect of New York hastening towards them until they were down amongst the hooting, teeming, petrol-smelling roots of the stressed-concrete jungle.</p> <p>Bond turned to his companion.</p> <p>'I hate to say it,' he said, 'but this must be the fattest atomic-bomb target on the whole face of the globe.'</p> <p>'Nothing to touch it,' agreed Halloran. 'Keeps me awake nights thinking what would happen.'</p> <p>They drew up at the best hotel in New York, the St Regis, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th Street. A saturnine middle-aged man in a dark blue overcoat and black homburg came forward behind the commissionaire. On the sidewalk, Halloran introduced him.</p> <p>'Mr Bond, meet Captain Dexter.' He was deferential. 'Can I pass him along to you now, Captain?'</p> <p>'Sure, sure. Just have his bags sent up. Room 2100. Top floor. I'll go ahead with Mr Bond and see he has everything he wants.'</p> <p>Bond turned to say good-bye to Halloran and thank him. For a moment Halloran had his back to him as he said something about Bond's luggage to the commissionaire. Bond looked past him across 55th Street. His eyes narrowed. A black sedan, a Chevrolet, was pulling sharply out into the thick traffic, right in front of a Checker cab that braked hard, its driver banging his fist down on the horn and holding it there. The sedan kept going, just caught the tail of the green light, and disappeared north up Fifth Avenue.</p> <p>It was a smart, decisive bit of driving, but what startled Bond was that it had been a negress at the wheel, a fine-looking negress in a black chauffeur's uniform, and through the rear window he had caught a glimpse of the single passenger - a huge grey-black face which had turned slowly towards him and looked directly back at him, Bond was sure of it, as the car accelerated towards the Avenue.</p> <p>Bond shook Halloran by the hand. Dexter touched his elbow impatiently.</p> <p>'We'll go straight in and through the lobby to the elevators. Half-right across the lobby. And would you please keep your hat on, Mr Bond.'</p> <p>As Bond followed Dexter up the steps into the hotel he reflected that it was almost certainly too late for these precautions. Hardly anywhere in the world will you find a negress driving a car. A negress acting as a chauffeur is still more extraordinary. Barely conceivable even in Harlem, but that was certainly where the car was from.</p> <p>And the giant shape in the back seat? That grey-black face? Mister Big?</p> <p>'Hm,' said Bond to himself as he followed the slim back of Captain Dexter into the elevator.</p> <p>The elevator slowed up for the twenty-first floor.</p> <p>'We've got a little surprise ready for you, Mr Bond,' said Captain Dexter, without, Bond thought, much enthusiasm.</p> <p>They walked down the corridor to the corner room.</p> <p>The wind sighed outside the passage windows and Bond had a fleeting view of the tops of other skyscrapers and, beyond, the stark fingers of the trees in Central Park.

Rebelling against this designation are those who prefer to be called &#x201c;Red Letter Christians,&#x201d; desiring to live out the red letters of Jesus&#x2019; words in the New Testament.&nbsp; Believing that Jesus is neither a Republican nor a Democrat, Red Letter Christians transcend partisan politics and concentrate on issues viewed critically through a moral and biblical lens.<br><br> Into this arena of thought steps Tony Campolo, the powerful evangelist known for his passionate and prophetic sharing of the radical message of Jesus.&nbsp; In this book, Campolo examines many of the hot-button issues facing Evangelicals from the perspective of Jesus&#x2019; red-letter words in the Bible. These include the environment, war, the AIDS crisis, Palestine, education, gun control, the role of government and choosing the right kind of candidate. No matter where you fall on the political spectrum, Campolo will make you think, pray and act.<br><br> Tony writes this book with the Bible in one hand and the newspaper in the other, reminding us that our faith must affect how we live in this world.

I want it to be known that there are millions of us who espouse an evangelical theology, but who reject being classified as part of the Religious Right. We don&#x2019;t want to make Jesus into a Republican.<br><br> On the other hand, we want to say loud and clear that we don&#x2019;t want to make Jesus in a Democrat, either.<br><br> Early twentieth-century playwright and social critic George Bernard Shaw once said that God created us in His image&#x2014;and we decided to return the favor! Clearly there are those on the Religious Right who would make Jesus into a Republican and an incarnation of their political values. And on the other side of the aisle, there are those who would make Jesus into a Democrat who espouses their particular liberal agenda.<br><br> But Jesus refuses to fit into any of our political ideologies. Transcending partisan politics, Jesus calls us to make judgments about social issues as best we can when we vote, and to do so in accord with our best understanding of God&#x2019;s will. In doing so, we are to avoid partisan politics that lead to unnecessary, unproductive and even dangerous divisions.<br><br> At election time when you are asked, &#x201c;Are you a Democrat or a Republican?&#x201d; your answer should be, &#x201c;Name the issue!&#x201d; On any specific social or political issue, we must be ready and willing to work out which party and/or candidate best represents our convictions.<br><br> This, of course, will make voting into a difficult decision-making process.

The movie had been a good one, a lighthearted romp that had made her laugh aloud several times and left her in a cheerful mood. As she walked briskly to her car, she thought she could tell which movie people had seen by how they were acting now. It wasn't that difficult; the couples who were holding hands, or even exchanging kisses in the parking lot, had obviously seen the sexy romance. The aggressive bunch of teenage boys had seen the latest martial arts thriller. The well-dressed young professionals who were in earnest discussions had seen the latest <i>Thelma and Louise</i> imitation. Marlie was glad she had chosen the comedy.<br><br>It was as she was driving home on the brightly lit expressway that it hit her: She felt good. The best she had felt in years. Six years, to be precise.<br><br>In startled retrospect, she realized that she had been at peace for several months now, but she had been so caught up in the sedative routine of the life she had built here that she hadn't noticed. For a long time she had simply existed, going through the motions, but time had done its slow work and eventually she had healed, like an amputee recovering from the loss of a limb and learning to cope, then to enjoy life again. Her loss had been mental rather than physical, and unlike an amputee, she had prayed through dark, endless nights that she never recover that part of herself. At some point in the past six years, she had stopped living in dread that the knowing would return, and simply gotten on with her life.<br><br>She liked being normal. She liked being able to go to movies the way normal people did, liked being able to sit in a crowd; she hadn't been able to do that before. Several years ago, when she had realized it was actually possible, she had turned into a movie junkie for a while, visually gorging on the films that she thought were safe. For a long time any degree of violence was unbearable, but for the past couple of years she had been able to watch the occasional thriller, though they weren't her favorite type. To her surprise, she hadn't yet been able to watch any sex scenes; she would have thought that violence would have been immeasurably mote difficult for her to handle, maybe even impossible, but instead it was the portrayal of intimacy that gave her problems. Dr. Ewell had been fond of saying that no one should ever lay bets on the human psyche, and she was amused to find he was right. The violence in her life had been traumatic, devastating, while the sex had been merely unpleasant, but it was the "love" scenes that still had her squeezing her eyes shut until it was over.<br><br>She exited off the expressway onto a four-lane street, and of course was caught by the traffic light at the bottom of the exit ramp. The radio was tuned to an easy-listening station and she inhaled deeply, feeling the slow music and the lingering lightheartedness of the movie combine in a delicious, physical sense of contentment --<br><br><i>-- the knife flashed down, gleaming dully. A sodden, muffled THUNK! as it struck. The blade rose again, dripping red --</i><br><br>Marlie jerked back, an unconscious physical denial of the horribly real image that had just flashed in her mind. "No," she moaned softly to herself. She could hear her own breathing, sharp and gasping.<br><br>"No," she said again, though she already knew the protest was useless. Her hands were clenched on the steering wheel, white-knuckled, and even that wasn't enough to stop the trembling that started at her feet and went all the way up. Dimly she watched her hands start shaking as the spasms intensified.<br><br><i>-- Black, gloating pleasure. Triumph. Contempt --</i><br><br>It was happening again. Dear God, <i>it was coming back!</i> She had thought herself free, but she wasn't. The knowing was coming closer, growing, looming, and she knew from experience that soon it would overwhelm her. Clumsily, her coordination already deteriorating, she steered the car to the right, so she wouldn't block the exit ramp. A car horn blared as she wavered too close to the vehicle beside her, but the noise was distant, muted. Her vision was fading. Desperately she braked to a stop and shoved the gear lever into park, hoping that she had managed to get completely out of traffic, but then the nightmare image was back, hitting her full strength like a beacon that had brushed by her in search before homing in.<br><br>Her hands fell limply into her lap. She sat in the car staring straight ahead, her eyes unblinking, unseeing, everything focused inward.<br><br>Her breathing became harsher. Rough sounds began to form in her throat, but she didn't hear them. Her right hand lifted slowly from her lap and formed itself into a fist, as if she were gripping something. The fist twitched violently, three times, in a rigidly restrained stabbing motion. Then she was quiet again, her face as still and blank as a statue's, her gaze fixed and empty.<br><br>It was the sharp rapping on the window beside Marlie that brought her back. Confused and exhausted, for a terrifying moment she had no idea who she was, or where, or what was happening. An unearthly blue light was flashing in her eyes. She turned a dazed, uncomprehending look at the man who was bent over, peering into the window as he tapped on it with something shiny. She didn't know him, didn't know anything. He was a stranger, and he was trying to get into her car. Panic was sharp and acrid in her mouth. <br><br>Then identity, blessed identity, returned with a rush and brought reality with it. The shiny thing the man was using to rap against the glass transformed itself into a flashlight. A glint on his chest became recognizable as a badge, and he, frown and commanding voice and all, was a policeman. His patrol car, Mars lights flashing, was parked at an angle in front of hers.<br><br>The images of horror were still too close, too frighteningly real. She knew she had to block it out or she wouldn't be able to function at all, and she needed to get control of herself. Some vague danger was threatening, some memory that danced close to the surface but wouldn't quite crystalize. Desperately she pushed away the fog of confusion and fumbled to roll down the window, fighting for the strength to complete even that small act. The exhaustion was bone-deep, paralyzing, muscles turned to mush.<br><br>Warm, humid air poured through the open window. The officer flashed the light beam around the interior of her car. "What's the problem here, ma'am?"<br><br>She felt cotton-brained, thought processes dulled, but even so she knew better than to blurt out the truth. That would immediately get her hauled in on suspicion of being under the influence of some kind of drug, probably a hallucinogen. Yes, that was it; that was the vague danger she had sensed. A night in jail, for a normal person, would be bad enough; for her, under these circumstances, it could be catastrophic.<br><br>She had no idea how much time had passed, but she knew that she must look pale and drained. "Ah...I'm sorry," she said. Even her voice was shaky. Desperately she sought for a believable explanation. "I -- I'm an epileptic. I began to feel dizzy and pulled over. I think I must have had a slight seizure."<br><br>The flashlight beam sought her face, played across her features. "Please step out of the car, ma'am."<br><br>The trembling was back; she didn't know if her legs would hold her. But she got out, holding to the open door for support. The blue lights stabbed her eyes, and she turned her head away from the brightness as she stood there pinned in the glare, a human aspen, visibly quaking.<br><br>"May I see your driver's license?"<br><br>Her limbs were leaden. It was an effort to retrieve her purse, and she dropped it immediately, the contents spilling half in the car, half on the ground. Innocuous contents, thank God; not even an aspirin bottle or pack of cigarettes. She was still afraid to take over-the-counter medications, even after six years, because the mental effects could be so unpredictable.<br><br>By concentrating fiercely, holding the crippling fatigue at bay, she managed to pick up her wallet and get out her license. The policeman silently examined it, then returned it to her. "Do you need help?" he finally asked.<br><br>"No, I'm feeling better now, e-except for the sh-shakes," she said. Her teeth were chattering from reaction. "I don't live far. I'll be able to make it home."<br><br>"Would you like for me to follow you, make sure you get there okay?"<br><br>"Yes, please," she said gratefully. She was willing to tell any number of lies to keep from being taken to a hospital, but that didn't mean she had lost her common sense. She was incredibly tired, the aftermath worse than she remembered. And there was still the nightmare image -- knowing or memory, she couldn't tell -- to be dealt with, but she pushed it out of her mind. She couldn't let herself think about it; right now she had to concentrate only on the tasks at hand, which were remaining coherent, upright, and functional, at least until she could get home.<br><br>The policeman helped her pick up her belongings, and in a few moments she was behind the wheel again, edging back onto the pavement, driving with excruciating care because every movement was such an effort. Twice she caught herself as her eyes were closing, the darkness of unconsciousness inexorably closing in.<br><br>Then she was home, turning in to the driveway. She managed to get out of the car and wave at the officer. She leaned against the car, watching him drive away, and only when he turned the corner did she set herself to the task of getting inside the house. To safety.<br><br>With weak, shaking, uncooperative hands she looped the strap of her purse around her neck, so she wouldn't drop it. After pausing for a moment to gather strength, she launched herself away from the car in the direction of the front porch. As a launch, it was spectacularly lacking in power. She staggered like a drunk, her steps wavering, her vision fading. Every movement became more and more difficult as the fatigue grew like a living thing, overwhelming her muscles and taking them from her control. She reached the two steps leading up to the porch and stopped there, swaying slowly back and forth, her blurred gaze fixed on those two steps that normally required no effort at all. She tried to lift her foot enough to take the first step, but nothing happened. She simply couldn't do it. Iron weights were dragging around her ankles, holding her back.<br><br>She began to shiver, another familiar reaction from before, in that other life. She knew she had only a few minutes to get inside before she completely collapsed.<br><br>She dropped heavily to her knees, feeling the resulting pain as only a dull, distant sensation. She could hear her own harsh, strained breathing, echoing hollowly. Slowly, torturously, she dragged herself up the steps, fighting for each inch, fighting to keep the darkness at bay.<br><br>She reached the front door. Keys. She needed the keys to get in.<br><br>She couldn't think. The black fog in her brain was paralyzing. She couldn't remember what she had done with her keys. In her purse? Still in the car? Or had she dropped them? There was no way she could retrace her steps, no way she could remain conscious much longer. She began fumbling in her purse, hoping to find the key ring. She should be able to recognize it by touch; it was one of those stretchy bracelet things, the type that could be slid onto the wrist. She could feel metal, but it eluded her grasp.<br><br>Bracelet...She had slipped the keys onto her wrist. It was a habit so ingrained that she seldom even thought about it. The shaking was worse; she pulled the key ring off her wrist but couldn't manage to fit the key into the lock. She couldn't see, the blackness almost complete now. Desperately she tried again, locating the lock purely by touch, concentrating with her last fierce vestige of strength on the herculean task of guiding the key into the lock...Got it! Panting, she turned the key until she felt the click. There. Unlocked.<br><br>She mustn't forget the keys, mustn't leave them in the lock. She slid the bracelet back onto her wrist as she twisted the doorknob and the door swung open, away from her. She had been leaning on the door, and with that support suddenly gone she sprawled in the doorway, half in and half out of the house.<br><br><i>Just a little more,</i> she silently urged herself, and struggled to her hands and knees again. <i>Get in far enough to close the door. That's all.</i><br><br>It wasn't really crawling now. She dragged herself in, whimpering with the effort, but she didn't hear the noise. The door. She had to close the door. Only then could she give herself over to the blackness.<br><br>Her arm waved feebly, but the door was out of reach. She sent a command to her leg and somehow it obeyed, slowly lifting, kicking -- a very weak kick. But the door swung gently shut.<br><br>And then the darkness overwhelmed her.<br><br>She lay motionless on the floor as the clock ticked away the hours. The gray dawn light penetrated the room. The passing morning was marked by the path of sunlight, shining through a window, as it moved down the wall and across the floor to finally fall on her face. Only then did she move in a restless attempt to escape the heat, and the deep stupor changed into a more normal sleep.<br><br>It was late afternoon when she began to rouse. The floor wasn't the most comfortable of sleeping places; each shift of position brought a protest from her stiff muscles, nudging her toward consciousness. Other physical complaints gradually made themselves felt, a full bladder protesting the most insistently. She was also very thirsty.<br><br>She struggled to her hands and knees, her head hanging low like a marathon runner at the end of the race. Her knees hurt. She gasped at the sharp, puzzling pain. What was wrong with her knees? And why was she on the floor?<br><br>Dazedly she looked around, recognizing her own safe, familiar house, the cozy surroundings of the small living room. Something was tangled around her, hampering her efforts to stand -- she fought the twisted straps and finally hurled the thing away from her, then frowned because it looked familiar, too. Her purse. But why had her purse straps been around her neck?<br><br>It didn't matter. She was tired, so tired. Even her bones felt hollow.<br><br>She used a nearby chair to steady herself and slowly got to her feet. Something was wrong with her coordination; she stumbled and lurched like a drunk on the way to a common destination: the john. She found the comparison faintly humorous.<br><br>After she had taken care of her most pressing need, she ran a glass of water and gulped greedily, spilling it down her chin in the process. She didn't care. She couldn't remember ever being so thirsty before. Or so tired. This was the worst it had ever been, even worse than six years ago when -- <br><br>She froze, and her suddenly terrified gaze sought her own reflection in the mirror. The woman who stared back at her had her face, but it wasn't the soothingly ordinary face she had become accustomed to. It was the face from before, from six years in the past, from a life that she had thought, hoped, was finished forever.<br><br>She was pale, her skin taut with strain. Dark circles lay under her eyes, dulling the blue to a muddy shade. Her dark brown hair, normally so tidy, hung around her face in a mass of tangles. She looked older than her twenty-eight years, her expression that of someone who has seen too much, lived through too much.<br><br>She remembered the stark, bloody vision, the storm of dark, violent emotion that had taken control of her mind, that had left her empty...</p><h2>Belushi: A Biography</h2><p>On the day he turned thirty, John starred in America&#x2019;s number-one movie (<i>Animal House</i>), starred in the number-one late-night show (<i>Saturday Night Live</i>) and had recorded the number-one album (<i>Briefcase Full of Blues</i>).

It's a humorous, nostalgic show-biz-trivia goldmine.

He treats European witchcraft as a product of Christianity, grounded in heresy more than in the magic and sorcery that have existed in other societies. Skillfully blending narration with analysis, he shows how social and religious changes nourished the spread of witchcraft until large portions of medieval Europe were in its grip&#x2015;"from the most illiterate peasant to the most skilled philosopher or scientist."</p><p>A significant chapter in the history of ideas and their repression is illuminated by this book. Our growing fascination with the occult gives the author's affirmation that witchcraft arises at times and in areas afflicted with social tensions a special quality of immediacy.</p></p><p><p>Jeffrey Burton Russell is Professor of History Emeritus at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p><p>"Russell's contribution will undoubtedly become a standard reference work on witchcraft. It is a clear, straightforward account resting on meticulous textual analysis and comprehensive documentation."</p> (<i>The Review of Books and Religion</i>)<br><br><p>"A magnificent history.... Russell's survey of modern literature on the subject is in itself almost a major contribution, and his careful period-by-period and phase-by-phase description of the development of witchcraft through the fifteenth century is indispensable to any further serious treatment of the phenomenon in Europe."</p> (<i>Georgia Review</i>)<br><br><p>"Russell fills a real gap in the literature. He does so with the scholarly probity and sound good sense that arc the absolute prerequisites for any serious work on the subject, and he has composed his book for the general reader as well as the specialist.... In the course of his narrative Russell successfully lays to rest any number of erroneous 'well-known facts,' and he demonstrates that classical witchcraft was largely a creature of Christianity and that heresy was the strongest influence on its development as an idea."</p> (<i>History</i>)<br><br><p>"The study of witchcraft is of more than fleeting interest. To understand this phenomenon is to acquire a more profound understanding of man, society, and self. Thus Russell's book is of singular importance.... With insight the author demonstrates how political, social, economic, religious, and intellectual developments either fostered or militated against the growth of witchcraft."</p> (<i>Church History</i>)</p><h2>Zig: The Autiobiography of Zig Ziglar</h2><p>"Zig Ziglar epitomizes determination, perseverance, excellence, and a loving Christian spirit more than anyone I know! The world would be a better place if more of us were just like him."<br>--Kenneth H. Cooper, M.D., The Cooper Clinic, Dallas, Texas<br><br>Zig Ziglar, the motivational speaker who has galvanized audiences around the world and written more than a dozen perennially popular books, brings that same unbounded energy and clarity of vision to this candid, inspiring account of his own life and the forces that shaped it.<br><br>Every year, Zig Ziglar travels all over the world delivering a resounding message of hope and commitment in forums ranging from high-powered business conferences and church leadership assemblies to youth conventions and educational gatherings. In <i>Zig</i>, Ziglar chronicles another kind of journey: his own transformation from a struggling, not terribly successful salesman to the sales champion of several different companies, and finally to his current position as one of the world's best-known and most highly regarded motivational speakers and trainers. As he describes his experiences, he brings to life the essence of his teachings: &#x201c;You can have everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.&#x201d;<br><br>At the heart of Ziglar's story are the people who taught him the importance of balancing a commitment to hard work with compassion for others. His first teacher was his mother, who raised him alone after the early death of his father, and introduced him to the principles and values he has honored for the rest of his life. Her lessons were reinforced by many others&#x2013;from the men and women who became his business mentors to the friends and spiritual leaders who comforted and supported him when things got tough. Paying tribute to each of them, Ziglar zeroes in on the philosophy and traits that have enabled him to achieve success in business and in his personal life: discipline, hard work, common sense, integrity, commitment, and an infectious sense of humor. <br><br>Ziglar's speaking engagements and seminars along with a wide array of audio and video materials, books, and training manuals, have helped to trigger positive changes in small businesses, Fortune 500 companies, U.S. government agencies, nonprofit associations, religious organizations, schools, and prisons. At once engaging and enlightening, <i>Zig</i> provides a riveting portrait of the man who has achieved so much by embracing the simple but profound goal of helping others.</p><p>&#x201c;Zig Ziglar is absolutely one of the most amazing people God ever created!

She was a tireless member of the antiwar movement, the civil rights movement, the tenants&#x2019; rights movement, the anti-nuclear-power movement, and the Women&#x2019;s Pentagon Action, among other causes, and proved herself to be a passionate citizen of each of her communities&#x2015;New York City and rural Vermont.</p></p><p>Grace Paley, born in the Bronx in 1922, was a renowned writer and activist. Her <i>Collected Stories</i> was a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.

You can take the <i>Reader</i> to a rally and feel galvanized by Paley's conviction, or you can take it to bed late at night and find pleasure and comfort in humane prose." &#x2015;Alexandra Schwartz, <i>New Yorker</i> </p><p>"This new collection reminds us that Paley, despite her view of herself as writer/housewife, was not so much a writer who drifted onto political subjects from time to time; she was a full-time activist and moral leader who happened to be gifted at writing . . . Among the many pleasures of Paley&#x2019;s work is the reassurance it offers that, just as we survived the events of those years, by analogy, we may yet survive the things that menace us now . . . It&#x2019;s hard to think of another writer who has been admired for her virtuous, cheerful, and positive character as much as for her work." &#x2015;Diane Johnson, <i>The New York Review of Books</i></p><p>"If the <i>Reader </i>was intended as a memorial, published a decade after her death, it now seems more pressing&#x2015;a necessary antidote to the current demoralization of the American left and the disorientation of what remains of the country&#x2019;s center. . . Of the voices of mid-century American radicalism, few could ever make perseverance seem so vital.&#x201d; &#x2015;Nicholas Dames, <i>The Atlantic</i></p><p>"Grace Paley may be the most underrated of New York twentieth-century writers . . . Paley became a knower of women, a conscious feminist, and a writer all at once . . . There are many generous writers, and many who cared more for living and writing and their families than they cared for fame. But of all these Grace Paley is one of the very best, which <i>A Grace Paley Reader </i>knows." &#x2015;Joseph Livingstone, <i>New Republic</i></p><p>"[<i>A Grace Paley Reader</i>] reminds us that Paley the short-story writer was also Paley the activist, the pamphleteer, the poet, the community organizer, and the committed leftist . . . <i>A Grace Paley Reader</i> helps to return the writer to her historical moment, to the specific conditions that shaped her life as an artist and activist . . . Her fiction was more than just empathetic: It not only sought to understand the world from the point of view of others, but also insisted on how integral this sense of connection was to the work of radical politics." &#x2015;Maggie Doherty, <i>The Nation</i></p><p>"[<i>A Grace Paley Reader </i>is] the kind of retrospective that, in an era in which plot has given way to character, reveals the vital scope of [Paley's] influence.&#x201d; &#x2015;Megan O'Grady, <i>Vogue</i> (Must-Read Books of Spring 2017)</p><p>"The new <i>A Grace Paley Reader, </i>edited by Kevin Bowen and Nora Paley and introduced by George Saunders, makes accessible the writings of a woman who lived a life of tenacious and peaceful resistance.

And the longer I&#x2019;ve had it with me, the more I find myself identifying with a title that had at first seemed awfully studious.

As with all good writing, these stories are timeless . . . After encountering one of Paley&#x2019;s stories, it is hard to leave it behind. It&#x2015;and the characters who fill it&#x2015;linger. In his introduction to this volume, author George Saunders calls Paley &#x2018;a kind of secular saint&#x2019;&#x2015;a saint of seeing.

[this] new collection . . . brings together work from the course of her career and provides a much-needed reminder of its importance . . . Her work remains indelible." &#x2015;Paul Wilner, <i>The Millions</i></p><p>"Grace Paley is the most intelligent, generous, incorruptible writer I ever knew. Her daughter says, &#x201c;I learned from her that precision requires a warm eye, not a cold one,&#x201d; and so did we all. Keen wit and real modesty seldom occur in such happy alliance. Who she was is what she writes. She never shows off, never bullies. She asks us what do you think about this? and is interested in our answer. She takes nothing for granted and everything as worth rethinking. Her writing on social issues remains timely because it was never superficial; she held understanding more useful than judgment. Very few writers can match the offhand voice, with its unmistakable oral cadence, in which her poignant, funny short stories are told. Her poem &#x201c;Responsibility&#x201d; set the standard she herself met, and her poetry, always at the service of moral issues, is still giving readers lines to live by. This excellent anthology of her work is a gift of her generous spirit to the rest of this century. I hope it finds the love, warmth, and honor it offers us all." &#x2015; Ursula K. Le Guin</p><p>&#x201c;Grace Paley&#x2019;s work has a way of surprising us in times of reckoning. There&#x2019;s no other voice of calm, deliberate certainty as hers. She possesses the capacity of observation alive with a resolve raised out of the Bronx. This &#x2018;once in a lifetime&#x2019; realist has endured, but, most of all, we need Grace now. <i>A Grace Paley Reader</i> is the best we can do in these times. Whether writing from behind the bars of a Greenwich Village jail where she spent six days for protesting; or deciphering the complexity of love, race and class, motherhood, fidelity, and capitalism; or reporting from North Vietnam, Paley reminds us of a larger responsibility through a personal vernacular that resonates out to the world.&#x201d; &#x2015;Yusef Komunyakaa</p><p>&#x201c;Has there ever been an author like Paley? A poet and essayist but primarily a short story writer, she functioned, before her death in 2007 at age 84, as a kind of conscience to the culture, an activist who saw art-making as political from the start . . . her short stories are among the finest produced by an American . . .

Mustafa Kemal Atat�rk was virtually unknown until 1919, when he took the lead in thwarting the victorious Allies' plan to partition the Turkish core of the Ottoman Empire. He divided the Allies, defeated the last Sultan, and secured the territory of the Turkish national state, becoming the first president of the new republic in 1923, fast creating his own legend. <br><br> Andrew Mango's revealing portrait of Atat�rk throws light on matters of great importance today-resurgent nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and the reality of democracy.</p><p>Andrew Mango was born in Istanbul. He wrote his first article on Turkey for the <i>Political Quarterly</i> in 1957. Since then he has published dozens of articles, as well as two general introductions to Turkey. He is the author, most recently, of <i>Turkey: The Challenge of a New Role</i> (1994).In 1923, reports Mango, a satirical magazine ran a cartoon showing the three faces of Turkey--the nation, the assembly and the government. All were identical: the features were those of Mustafa Kemal (1881-1938), an army officer who had salvaged the core of defeated Turkey after the 1914-1918 war to create a secular republic. A decade later, still trying to structure an identity for what remained of the polyglot, ramshackle Ottoman Empire, he decreed--as virtual dictator of a nation now largely populated by Muslims--that inhabitants had to take surnames. For himself, he adopted Ataturk, literally Father Turk. Mango (a retired BBC expert on Turkey and author of three previous books on the country) gives this man, one of the least-known nation-builders of the last century, full treatment, from his earliest days to his ascension to power and his death, from cirrhosis at the age of 57. Few leaders have so modernized an ancient society, instituting radical changes in dress, religion, government, education--even the alphabet. Ataturk abolished the monarchy, divided WWI's victors bent on partitioning all of Turkey, defeated rapacious Greeks intent on expanding their expatriate communities in Asia and destroyed or co-opted his domestic rivals. That so much of his legacy survives is evidence of his success. Mango's admiration for Ataturk doesn't keep him from displaying the dictator's arrogance, ruthlessness and authoritarianism; his Turkish expertise enables him to flesh out Ataturk's complex life via sources he translated himself. Mango gives a rounded, finely detailed portrait of the man who created modern Turkey. B&amp;w photos.

He originally intended to become a doctor and earned his degree before turning to what was then a medium for children. His many early masterpieces include the series known in the U.S. as <i>Astro Boy</i>. With his sweeping vision, deftly interwined plots, feel for the workings of power, and indefatigable commitment to human dignity, Tezuka elevated manga to an art form. The later Tezuka, when he authored Buddha, often had in mind the mature readership that manga gained in the sixties and that had only grown ever since. The Kurosawa of Japanese pop culture, Osamu Tezuka is a twentieth century classic."A relentless page-turner boasting a cast of hundreds, <i>Buddha: Volume 3: Devadatta</i> concerns Siddhartha's earliest ordeals after he forswears his kingdom to lead a life of ascetic purity...Siddhartha's comtemplative life becomes a swashbuckling adventure." - <b><i>Newsday</i></b><br>"Infused with humor and history, the epic of Siddhartha is perhaps Osamu Tezuka's crowning acheivement and illustrates why, without irony, Tezuka is referred to as 'The King of Japanese Comics'." -<b><i> LA Weekly</i></b>"Buddha is one of Tezuka's true masterpieces.

The armchair philosopher, the devout Buddhist, the casual manga fan - this book satisfies all with its tale of humanism through sequential art, and definitely earns its place on a bibliophile's bookshelf." -<b><i>Anime Insider</i></b>"This is one of the greatest acheivements of the comics medium, a masterpiece by one of the greats." -<b><i>Artbomb.net</i></b>"In Tezuka's world, the exquisite collapses into the goofy in a New York minute, the goofy into the melodramatic, the melodramatic into the brutal, and the brutal into the sincerely touching. The suprising result is a work wholly unique and downright fun." -<b><i>Time Out NY</i></b><i>"</i>Tezuka's Buddha is a striking and memorable confluence of ancient wisdom and contemporary popular art." -<b><i>Yoga Journal<br><br></i></b></p><h2>Skin</h2><p><p>A freak storm has spawned three tornadoes that are bearing down on the town of Summerville.</p><p>Yet under the cover of the storm looms a much more ominous threat: A vindictive killer known as Red who's left a string of victims in his wake and is now bent on exacting his final revenge on the unsuspecting town.</p><p>But there is an enigma surrounding Red that the FBI is unwilling to admit-closely guarded secrets of something gone terribly wrong beneath the skin of Summerville.

Ted lives in Austin with his wife LeeAnn and their four children.<p> <strong>Chapter One</strong></p> <p> When the rain isn't so much falling--be it in bucket loads or like cats and dogs--but rather slamming into the car like an avalanche of stone, you know it's time to pull over. </p> <p> When you can't see much more than the slaphappy wipers splashing through rivers on the windshield, when you're suddenly not sure if you're on the road any longer, and your radio emits nothing but static, and you haven't seen another car since the sky turned black, and your fingers are tense on the wheel in an attempt to steady the old Accord in the face of terrifying wind gusts, you know it's so totally time to pull over. </p> <p> Wendy leaned over the steering wheel, searching for the yellow lines that separated the two-lane highway. No real shoulder that she could see. What was to keep another car from rear-ending her if she pulled over here? </p> <p> She'd seen the black clouds pillaring on the horizon as she headed across the Nevada desert. Heard the tornado warnings on the radio before it had inexplicably fried. The fact that this wasn't tornado territory had the announcers in a bit of a frenzy. </p> <p> Wendy had ignored the warnings and pressed on into evening. She'd given herself two days for the long haul between San Diego and western Utah. The call from her mother asking her to come had frozen Wendy for a good ten seconds, phone in hand. Had to be Thursday, this week, her mother had insisted. It was now Tuesday night. Wendy wondered if she'd see the rest of the Brotherhood cult or just her mother. The thought of either was enough to keep her awake at night. </p> <p> The tribe, as its leader Bronson called it, was a somewhat nomadic group of twenty or so members, going where God led them. God had evidently led them to the remote Utah-Nevada border now. </p> <p> Wendy had been born into the cult and had managed to escape eight years earlier, on her eighteenth birthday, the day she was to wed Torrey Bronson as his third wife. Twice she'd hired private investigators to locate the tribe and report on her mother's condition. Twice the report had come back favorable. But the investigators had never actually talked to her mother--speaking to anyone from the outside world was strictly prohibited. Even making eye contact was good for a day in isolation. Physical contact, heaven forbid, was grounds for severe punishment. </p> <p> Inside the cult there was plenty of touching and hugging and kissing, but no physical contact with strangers ever, period. That was the Brotherhood way. </p> <p> Wendy had fallen in an Oklahoma ditch when she was seven years old and broken her leg. A farmer had heard her cries and taken her to the others who were searching. Before setting the bone, "Father" Bronson had beaten her severely for allowing unclean hands to touch her. The lashing hurt more than the broken leg. It was the last time Wendy had touched or been touched by anyone outside the tribe before escaping. </p> <p> And when Father Bronson had taken it upon himself to break her two thumbs and two forefingers as punishment for kissing Tony, another thirteen-year-old in the tribe at the time, he'd made it excruciatingly clear that he'd claimed her for himself alone. </p> <p> She'd fled the cult, but not the wounding of such a perverse childhood. Few knew the extent of the damage; she hid it well behind soft eyes and a light smile. But to this day even the thought of physical contact with men unnerved her. </p> <p> No issue in Wendy's tumultuous life consumed her as much as this failing. Touch was her personal demon. A beast that prevented her from expressing the deep caring she'd felt in any relationship with a man, isolating her from love, romantic or otherwise. </p> <p> Now, driving through nature's fury, she felt oddly isolated again. It was suddenly clear that her decision to continue into the dark clouds had been a mistake. </p> <p> As if hearing and understanding that it had played unfairly with her, the storm suddenly eased. She could see the road again. </p> <p> See, now that wasn't so bad . . . Time to retreat to the nearest over�crowded motel to wait out the storm with the rest of the traveling public. </p> <p> She could even see the signs now, and the green one she passed said that the turnoff to Summerville was in five miles. Exit 354. A hundred yards farther, a blue sign indicated that there were no services at this exit. </p> <p> Freak storm. Flash floods. Truth be told, it was all a bit exciting. As long as the storm didn't delay her, she kind of liked the idea of-- </p> <p> Her headlights hit a vehicle in the road ahead. Like a wraith, the cockeyed beast glared at her through the rainy night, unmoving, dead on the road. A pickup truck. </p> <p> She slammed her foot on the brake. </p> <p> The Accord's rear wheels lost traction on the wet pavement and slid around to her left. She gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white. Her headlights flashed past the scrub oak lining the road. </p> <p> For an instant Wendy thought the car might roll. But the wet asphalt kept the Accord's wheels from catching and throwing her over. </p> <p> Unfortunately, the slick surface also prevented the tires from stopping her car before it crashed into the pickup. </p> <p> Wendy jerked forward, allowing her forearms to absorb most of the impact. </p> <p> Steam hissed from under her hood. Rain splattered. But Wendy was unhurt, apart from maybe a bruise or two. She sat still, collecting herself. </p> <p> Oddly enough, the airbags hadn't deployed. Maybe it was the angle. She'd hit the other vehicle's front bumper in a full slide, so that her left front fender had taken the brunt of the impact before becoming wedged under the grill. </p> <p> She picked up her cell phone and snapped it open. No Service. </p> <p> No service for more than half an hour now. </p> <p> She tried the door. It squealed some, then opened easily before striking the smallish pickup, which she now saw was green. She climbed out, hardly noticing the rain. The pickup was missing its right front wheel and sat on the inner guts of the brake contraption--which explained the tire she now saw in the road. Her eyes returned to the pickup's door. The side window was shattered. The front windshield seemed intact, except for two round holes punched through on the driver's side. </p> <p> Bullet holes. </p> <p> Of course she couldn't be sure they were bullet holes, but it was the first thought to cross her mind, and since it had done so, she could hardly consider that mere debris had punched those two perfect circles through the glass. </p> <p> Someone had shot at the driver. </p> <p> Wendy jerked her head around for signs of another car or a shooter. Nothing she could see, but that didn't mean they weren't out there. For a moment she stood glued to the pavement, mind divided between the drenching she was receiving from the rain, and those two bullet holes. </p> <p> She remembered the pistol in the console compartment between her Accord's front seats. Louise had talked her into buying it long ago, when they'd first met at the shelter. Wendy had never received the training she'd intended to, nor had she ever fired the gun. But there it lay, and if ever there was a time for it . . . </p> <p> She flung the Accord's door wide and ducked inside. Finding and dislodging the black pistol case from between the seats proved a slippery, knuckle-burning task with wet fingers. Yet she managed to wrench it out. She disengaged the sliding mechanism that opened the case, snatched out the cold steel weapon, and fumbled it, trying to remember what the safety looked like. </p> <p> Meanwhile, her butt, which was still sticking out in the rain, was taking a bath. The gun slipped from her hands and thudded on the floor mat. She swore and reached for it, found the trigger, and would have blown a hole in the car if the safety had been off. </p> <p> Thank God for safeties. </p> <p> Now she found the safety and disengaged it. However unfamiliar she was with guns, Wendy was no idiot. Neither was she anything similar to gutless. </p> <p> Whoever was in the truck might still be alive, possibly even injured, and out here in this storm. And Wendy was the only one who could help. Sniper lurking or not, she would never abandon anyone in need. </p> <p> Wendy turned the key in the Accord's ignition. The car purred to life. It was still steaming through the hood, but at least it ran. </p> <p> She took a calming breath, then slipped back out of the car and hurried around to the truck's passenger door, staying low. </p> <p> With a last look around the deserted highway, keeping the gun in both hands down low the way she'd often seen such weapons wielded on the big screen, she poked her head up and looked through the passenger window. </p> <p> Empty. </p> <p> She stood up for a better look. The driver's window was smeared with something. Blood. But no body. Someone had been shot. The truck had apparently sideswiped another car and lost its front wheel before coming to a rest. </p> <p> Wendy scanned the shoulder and ditches for any sign of a fallen body. Nothing. </p> <p> Still no sign of a shooter, no sign of any danger. </p> <p> "Hello?" </p> <p> No response to her call. </p> <p> Louder this time. "Hello? Anybody out there?" </p> <p> No, nothing but the rain drumming on the vehicles. </p> <p> She started to shove the gun into the back of her Lucky jeans, which were now drenched right through to her skin, but a quick image of the gun blowing a hole in her butt stopped her short. </p> <p> It was then, hand still on the pistol at the small of her back, that she heard the cry. </p> <p> She jerked the gun to her left and listened. There it was again, farther down the road, hidden in the growing dark. An indistinguishable cry for help or of pain. </p> <p> Or the killer, howling at the moon in victory. </p> <p> The cry did not come again. Wendy crouched low and ran down the roadside toward the sound, gun extended. She wanted to yell but was torn, knowing that in the very unlikely case the sound had been made by whoever had shot at the truck, she would be exposing herself to danger. </p>...</p><h2>Every Dog Has His Day (Hank the Cowdog #10)</h2><p>It's&nbsp;roundup time on the ranch, but Hank was left behind!

Benny ? a hot shot, high-priced cowdog ? is running the show while Hank is tied to a fence post. After breaking his insulting restraint, Hank is heading to the corrals when he meets Drover and the lovely Miss Scamper.</p><p>"Well, hello there, you big hairy thing dragging a rope around." Miss Scamper said.</p><p>"You like that rope? I broke it just for you, just so I could come down here and feast my eyes on the roast beef of your face."</p><p>"You have a way with words. The only question is ? which way?"</p><p>She laughed. I laughed. We both laughed. I could tell she was impressed.</p><p>Drover barged into the conversation.</p><p>"Hank, there's cattle coming this way."</p><p>"Hush, Drover. Tell me, Miss Scamper, what can I do to convince you that my heart is in the right place?"</p><p>"Take it out and let me look at it."</p><p>"I beg your pardon?"</p><p>"Don't believe everything I say, big boy. It could get you into trouble."</p><p>"Oh, I see. You were joking? Ha ha, ho ho. You have a strange and delightful sense of humor, Miss Scamper."</p><p>"And it was subtle too, until you came along."</p><p>"Exactly. I don't know how you've managed all these years without me."</p><p>"It's been a real struggle."</p><p>"I can imagine! It might surprise you to know that I'm quite a humorist myself, Miss Scamper."</p><p>"You hide it very well."</p><p>"Yes, I've tried to disguise my humor behind a gruff facade, a French word meaning 'the front part of anything.'"</p><p>Her eyes widened in amazement.</p><p>"I didn't know you spoke French too."</p><p>"Oh yes. French, Thousand Island, Opengloppish, Pig Latin, Spanish, as well as several of the coyalect diotes...coyote dialects, that is."</p><p>Drover was beginning to hop up and down.</p><p>"Hank, something's going on, the cattle are coming this way, and here comes that new cowdog."</p><p>I peered out into the pasture. Sure enough, Benny the So-called Cowdog, was padding toward us. I squared my shoulders and waited. Some ten feet away, he stopped and glanced around.</p><p>"And so, Benny, we meet again," I said in one of my smoother tones of voice. "I'm not sure this ranch is both enough for big of us."</p><p>"Do you suppose you fellows could move out of the way?" he said. "We're trying to bring in cattle. Aren't you supposed to be tied?"</p><p>"Yes, I was tied. Yes, I broke the rope. No, we're not moving out of the way. And no, you're not bringing in any cattle without my permission. Any more questions?"</p><p>"Just one. Are you completely out of your mind?"</p><p>At that very moment, and for reasons which I didn't understand, Miss Scamper nodded her head.</p><p>"Because this is a roundup, you see, and we have work to do and you really don't fit into the overall dynamics." "That's where you're wrong, Benny. I've let this thing go far enough, and now I'm fixing to shut 'er down. The fact of the matter is that YOU don't fit into the overall hydraulics."</p><p>"Uh, dynamics, I think is the word you wanted."</p><p>"I said what I meant, Benny, and I'm afraid the old trick of putting words into my mouth won't work this time."</p><p>He shook his head.</p>"Good heavens, I thought I'd seen it all."<p>"No, as a matter of fact, you've only seen the beginning. Now pack your bags and get off my ranch."</p><p>He gave me a smirk.</p>"You obviously don't understand what you're saying, so I'll not argue. We WILL bring in the cattle, your opinions on the matter notwithstanding."<p>I took two steps toward him.</p>"Benny, old buddy, let me tell you something. I'll be withstanding in the gate when you start those cattle this way, and I'll see to it that you're exposed for what you are ? an impostor and a fraud."<p>"Well, it appears there's nothing more to be said."</p><p>"Exactly. Bring on the cattle. We'll see who's the cowdog around here."</p>Will Hank bring in the cattle and take back his rightful place as Head of Ranch Security?

But Meat Loaf (christened Marvin Lee Aday) and coauthor David Dalton succeed by skillfully modifying the tongue-in-cheek hyperbole and the bombastic befuddlement of the man's Wagner-crossed-with-the-Shangri-Las music to fit the printed page. Meat Loaf grew up in Dallas, Texas, the son of a schoolteacher (she penned a locally popular textbook on Communism) and an alcoholic cop (who happened to be an acquaintance of Jack Ruby). Meat--he earned the nickname early on--got in touch with his theatrical side as a teen and was soon off on his haphazard way, stumbling from misadventure to misadventure, and taking more than his fair share of knocks along the way. (Literally--he's suffered 17 concussions thus far, which provide an oddly effective narrative device.) He lurched into the middle of the JFK assassination scene, picked up a hitchhiking Charlie Manson, earned a part in <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i>, and recorded one of the most successful albums of the '70s, <i>Bat out of Hell</i>. His ample fame inevitably tied to his ample frame, Meat Loaf quickly became something of an amped-up Fatty Arbuckle. Then came the colossal excesses and flop follow-ups, capped by a rebound called--you guessed it--<i>Bat out of Hell II: Back into Hell</i>. Yes, it's a familiar framework, but the telling of Meat Loaf's rise, fall, and recovery is never anything less than fresh and absorbing. <i>--Steven Stolder</i><p>Meat Loaf has sold more than 50 million records worldwide and appeared in films such as <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Mighty, Crazy in Alabama,</em> and <em>The Fight Club.</em></p><p> David Dalton is the award-winning author of biographies on such pop icons as James Dean, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison.

It could climb and dive faster than the RAF fighters and its competitive edge in combat was helped by its direct injection fuel system. It also had the edge on both the Spitfire and Hurricane when it came to the punch delivered by its array of machine guns and shell-firing cannon. Its formidable performance and potent armament made the Bf109, arguably, the best fighter of the Battle. This book covers the history of the &#x2018;109, restoration to flight, the views of owners, pilots and engineers, operating and servicing. There are data boxes covering a wealth of &#x2018;109 facts and figures, and interviews with owners and pilots (both WW2 Luftwaffe pilots and modern day owner-pilots).&nbsp; Photographs and illustrations are drawn from a variety of sources, including Luftwaffe official wartime manuals, official and private archives, restoration projects in the UK and overseas.</p><p>Paul Blackah joined the RAF in 1976 and trained as an airframe fitter. In 1993 he was posted to the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. His specialized knowledge of vintage aircraft is considered crucial to the maintenance of the aircraft in the flight. In the 1990s Paul was closely involved in the restoration to flight of the Messerschmitt Bf109F &#x2018;Black 6&#x2019;. He is co-author with Alfred Price of the Supermarine Spitfire Manual.
